title: About this site

<p>
Currently, e-gineer is published as a personal <a href="../v2/blog/">blog</a> where 
<a href="../nathan/">Nathan Wallace</a> explores and publishes his ideas. Previously, the
site was a portal for web site engineers and the <a href="../archive/">archive</a> of articles 
and instructions still receive heavy traffic.

<p>The postings on this site are my own and don't necessarily represent my employer's positions, strategies or opinions.</p>
<h2>Defining "e-gineer"</h2>
<p><a href="../v1/presentation/v1-screenshot.gif">Originally</a>, I defined an e-gineer as "one versed in the design, construction and use of 
the Internet". Over the years however, it has evolved into a more general term that I think of as an "entrepreneurial engineer", "web engineer" or combination
of both.</p>
<h2>Technical infrastructure</h2>
<p>Learning from the pain of maintaining a dynamic site, e-gineer has been <a href="../v2/blog/2005/08/personal-it-website-weblog.html">static
  and generated since 2005</a>. Originally this was done with FTP publishing from
Blogger, but today it's done with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
