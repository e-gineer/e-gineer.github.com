					<div style="clear:both;"></div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>In February 2008, <a href="http://www.janssen-cilag.com.au/">Janssen-Cilag Australia &amp; New Zealand</a> launched an internal microblogging platform called Jitter. Combined with our intranet's people search capabilities, this formed an interesting enterprise hybrid of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> style capabilities. This People Search with Jitter solution received <a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/products/iia2008/winners">Highly Commended in the 2008 Intranet Innovation Awards</a>.</p><p>While <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/08/our-intranet-wiki-case-study-of-wiki.htm">our intranet wiki JCintra</a> continues to be highly successful, we wanted to keep building our culture of collaboration by capturing and highlighting the flow of ideas. We also wanted to make it easier for our field force to participate and collaborate. </p><p>This post is an overview of our approach and outlines some of the lessons learned for others to consider as part of their journey.</p><p><strong>People Search with Jitter</strong></p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchHome.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchHome-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>This is the home page of the People Search component. Note the simple search box, followed by a list of recent/common searches and then a random face from the organisation.</p><p>On the right hand side you can see Jitter posts integrated with the main site news feed. The last 3 posts are shown as a group, and are injected into the news feed based on the latest post timestamp of the news / Jitters.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchNameSearch.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchNameSearch-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Searching for a name (e.g. Nathan) shows results from first or last name matches. This quick view allows immediate use of the telephone numbers etc, and incorporates information from our local company system (<a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/juice-user-centric-approach-to-it.htm">Juice</a>) and other operating companies through integration with the Outlook Corporate Directory they populate.</p><p>Search results are immediate (no Enter click required) and use an AJAX component to prevent the need for full intranet page refresh.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchTeamSearch.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchTeamSearch-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Users may choose to search for a team name (e.g. Information), which returns a picture wall of faces from matching teams.</p><p>Note that team and individual results may be mixed together depending on the search term and matches.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchPersonView.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchPersonView-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Simple page displaying all information for Nathan Wallace. The latest Jitter post is integrated as a status message.</p><p>The organisational hierarchy is displayed, including peers, direct reports and his manager. Clicking on those faces navigates the hierarchy. Green arrows show if a team is present under that person.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchSMSSending.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchSMSSending-Thumbnail.png" /></a> </p><p>SMS sending is integrated into the People Search. Messages can be addressed to individuals or entire teams.</p><p>If the sender has a mobile, the message appears to have come from their number. If not, there is no reply number, but instead a short text based name is shown on the recipients phone as the sender.</p><p>SMS costs are billed to the senders cost centre through <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/juice-user-centric-approach-to-it.htm">the Juice system</a>.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchJitterPosting.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchJitterPosting-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Users can post to Jitter by clicking "Update status" in the Jitter section of the news feed, clicking "update" in the Jitter section of their People Search profile or by sending a text message to the designated mobile phone number.</p><p>Posting is done inline, fast to complete and published immediately. Note that SMS following is also available in the system for real time notification of new posts.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchJitterArchive.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/PeopleSearchJitterArchive-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>An archive of previous Jitter posts is available for browsing.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p><strong>Adoption and business impact </strong></p><p>So far, 59 different people have contributed a total of 306 posts to Jitter. We’re excited that about 17% of people have tried posting, but disappointed that posting remains so infrequent and experimental. Here are some examples: </p><ul><li>State of our public hospitals June 2008 report now available at: <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/ahca">http://www.health.gov.au/ahca</a> </li><li>Neuro Specialist Team your cycle meeting accreditation guide can be found on the Topamax specialist team private space. Please review prior to cycle!! </li><li>Suffering from glute meltdown... </li><li>Whoo-hoo! This weekend Trudi became the new Australian Swing Dance Balboa champion. </li><li>XYZ still appears to be down - I have requested ETA on when this may be back and will notify the business when I have an answer. </li><li>Please come and get some friday snacks from my fundraising box in downstairs kitchen. These are to buy new toys and equipment for my baby's daycare. </li><li>Dear colleagues, I need a lift to Gordon or Pymble for the next 3 days. Anyone live that way ? </li><li>Jitter, Jotter, Blotter, Blatter, Matter! Does it? </li></ul><p>Jitter has settled into a pattern as our informal news channel. It’s used for public congratulations, for sharing links and for short news flashes. This is a communication need that is infrequent, but not served by email (too intrusive) or JCintra news (too formal).</p><p>As a comparison, our SMS message sending tool has seen 104 users send 1852 messages to 5162 recipients. It is commonly used for announcements to the field force and individual messages from office based assistants to travelling executives. Usage has continued to grow each quarter since it was launched.</p><p><strong>Lessons Learned </strong></p><p>The flow of news on JCintra has been hugely successful and filled a natural need for the organisation. But Jitter wasn’t <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/building-enterprise-20-on-culture-10.htm">responding to a need, it tried to create demand</a>. Open collaboration and idea sharing are common organisational goals, but that doesn’t mean there is latent demand among the people of the business for the tools that enable it. With any new organisational capability, always stay focused on end users and helping them to solve a problem. </p><p>While Jitter is a highly flexible tool that people are already using for a wide range of purposes, we didn’t do enough to position this new communication medium or to demonstrate the business value. People didn’t know how to use this new tool. Some feedback was negative, but overwhelmingly people asked “What do I post to it?”, “What’s the business value?”. Without clear answers, people just waited to see what others would do. </p><p>People have no idea what Twitter is. People have no idea what microblogging is. Most people don’t know what wiki’s, blogs or social networks are either. When explaining Jitter, one user was even worried that this meant that all the SMS text messages they sent to anyone would now be published on the Intranet. These technologies are natural and well known to people like us, but for the vast majority of people in the world they are new, confusing and weird. Remember to design your solutions and train people as though your mum is the key user! </p><p>Microblogging is particularly difficult to position as a business tool since it’s so hard to say anything worthwhile in so few characters. For an organisation starting the journey of sharing ideas and thoughts, blogging may be an easier starting point. Posts can be more serious and business like. Blogs are better known, and at worst look more like normal web pages. Authors can craft and position their entries to meet the political challenges and communication realities of the enterprise. Even if your organisation is ready for fast thoughts and short posts, authors can evolve towards really short blog entries. </p><p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p><p>In a <a href="http://rossdawsonblog.com/weblog/archives/2008/10/microblogging_i.html">recent post on microblogging in the enterprise</a> Ross Dawson said "It's a learning process. We must discover what a whole array of new communication technologies allow us to do as organizations. We don't know yet. But we do know that they might make a massive difference to how effective we can be. So those who are the first to work it out will be ahead. No doubt about it.".</p><p>At Janssen-Cilag, we’re a step or two closer to working it out.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Frustrated users end up expensing high cost, non-standard equipment and building <a href="http://mikeschaffner.typepad.com/michael_schaffner/2007/01/we_need_more_sh.html">shadow IT</a> solutions.</p><p>Determined to find a better way, we started a project with 3 aims:</p><ol><li>It should be easier to buy something internally than externally.</li><li>Equipment orders and new starters are always urgent, so make that the default case.</li><li>IT needs macro-level control of standards and procurement. Users and managers need micro-level control of equipment and cost-benefit decisions.</li></ol><p>With one person working on the process and another working on the system development, within 4 months we launched Juice. This case study presents our journey and results 12 months after launch, recognised by our <a href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/products/iia2008/winners">Gold award in the Business Solutions category of the 2008 Intranet Innovation Awards</a>.</p><p><strong>Before Juice</strong></p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKits.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKits-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>High level standards were in place (e.g. Dell D630 laptop), but low level customisation was allowed (e.g. 4GB RAM instead of standard 2GB) leading to a wide range of parts and supported systems. With standards control and provision approval, ad-hoc decisions were continually required by IT as to what equipment should be supplied to individual users, for example, does this user do enough travel to justify a light-weight laptop? (Of course, in the end users work out to play the <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/Business+Entry+Point/Business+Topics/Occupational+health+and+safety/">OH&amp;S</a> card and get what they want.)</p><p>Processes were designed for the best case (knowing weeks in advance about new starters), not the usual case (they start tomorrow). New equipment orders were placed as required, with a lead time of weeks to delivery and deployment. In addition, equipment was owned by and depreciated to individual cost centres throughout the business. This combination fostered a high level of ownership, but lead to protectionism, non-compliance, misallocation of costs and wasted resources as equipment sat in cupboards as departments tried to ensure a smooth entry for new starters.</p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceCatalog.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceCatalog-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>This ad-hoc ownership and provision meant that broken equipment endured long downtime periods, particularly for remote users, as it was returned, fixed and then sent back. For new starters, equipment like PDA’s may even passed directly from ex-employees to new employees with no review, training or quality check. </p><p>Things worked before Juice, because everyone cared about the end user and worked hard to deliver. But, everyone was frustrated, spot fires were common and a lot of excess effort was required to make things run smoothly.</p><p><strong>Managing equipment as kits</strong></p><p>All equipment is now defined in kit form. For example: Dell D630 Laptop, BlackBerry 8100 Pearl, Lenovo 20" monitor docking station.</p><p>Each kit may have a number of accessories. For example: The Dell D630 Laptop includes a mouse, battery, carry bag, power pack and network cable. Whether they are new or previously used, shipped kits always include exactly those accessories. We chose to remove printed manuals, software CD's, etc.</p><p>Lost or broken accessories may be individually replaced through single-click ordering. No approval is required as they are cheap and considered essential to the functioning of the kit. If a kit is returned incomplete, we simply charge the user for any missing accessories.</p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceViewAKit.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceViewAKit-Thumbnail.png" /></a><p>Each kit has a key item (e.g. the laptop itself). If that item is lost, stolen or broken then the entire kit is replaced. For example, we will send a completely new laptop kit including all accessories and ask for the old laptop / accessories to be returned. This ensures that we are always shipping kits complete and tested.</p><p>Where possible we use a "swap &amp; repair" model to deal with problematic equipment and minimise downtime. For example, if a user is having trouble with their PDA we simply configure a new one and send it out immediately. The old PDA is then returned, repaired and reused in the future by another user.</p><p>This kit-based approach is highly flexible and allows the system to move beyond IT. We also track corporate credit cards, phone numbers and storage lockers as kits in Juice.</p><p><strong>The financial model</strong></p><p>We decided that departments must control their own costs, while IT provides standards, service and guidance. If IT is a gatekeeper to individual needs and owns costs we'll always be crushed by low level decisions, limiting the business with strict policies and eventually worked around through shadow IT or creative business / safety / any reasoning.</p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceActivityTracking.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceActivityTracking-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Instead, IT must control the standards, options and service. While users and managers must own the cost and have the freedom to make personal equipment choices.</p><p>As such, in Juice all equipment is purchased, owned and depreciated by the IT department. Based on the cost and useful life of each kit, they are leased to users at a fixed daily rate. This has a number of advantages:</p><ul><li>Equipment can be optimally moved between departments and users. (Items owned by individuals are heavily protected and difficult to relocate.)</li><li>Equipment moves from a hidden, uncontrollable cost (depreciation) to a controllable IT cost charged monthly. Managers can now engage in a conversation on how to reduce their IT costs or get better value for money.</li><li>Equipment is only required for active users &amp; a buffer, so less capital is tied up in equipment for vacant positions.</li><li>Users only pay for a kit while they are using it. This encourages the reuse and return of equipment, and encourages IT to maintain the lowest possible inventory that meets service standards. </li></ul><p>If a kit is lost, broken or stolen the residual value is charged to the owner's cost centre. While harsh in some cases, this provides encouragement to properly care for and safeguard equipment at all times.</p><p>If a user chooses to replace or upgrade a kit, they pay half the residual value of the kit they currently own. (This is a deterrent to upgrading early, but also discourages people from just reporting the kit as lost or broken.)</p><p>In the end, IT owns macro-level standards, cost control and service levels. Users own micro-level decisions, needs and cost-benefit choices.</p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuicePlaceAnOrder.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuicePlaceAnOrder-Thumbnail.png" /></a><p><strong>Approvals and workflow</strong></p><p>New kits (e.g. I need a data projector), kit upgrades (e.g. I want a lightweight laptop), or kit replacements (e.g. I lost my PDA) require manager approval. This single step workflow is fast, effective and completed by the cost centre owner.</p><p>Replacement accessories do not require any approval, they are considered essential to keep the kit in good working order and charged immediately to your team cost centre. For transparency, these charges do appear in the managers monthly bill.</p><p>Users and managers have freedom, transparency and accountability for their purchase decisions and costs. IT has no involvement in these approval or workflow stages, we are not a gatekeeper. Our job is to maintain an appropriate menu of equipment, agree recommendations of standard kits per role and to provide high quality equipment, service and training.</p><p><strong>Onboarding &amp; Offboarding</strong></p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceTeam.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceTeam-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Without good people control, you cannot have good asset or equipment control.</p><p>Juice synchronises each night with our HR system, detecting any additions, reductions or changes to the organisation structure. Juice also stores a position hierarchy for the business, including predefined employee types with standard equipment. We synchronise the HR changes with the position structure to create appropriate orders in the system.</p><p>As a result, we have no new starter forms for IT. This is a huge improvement from forms requesting accounts, ad-hoc requests for security access and equipment orders done on a person-by-person basis. For managers, the work has dramatically reduced. For new starters, the process is far more reliable.</p><p>Juice also stores cost centre and team information, inherited down through the organisational tree. With this information, Juice simplifies approvals and allocates charge backs.</p><p><strong>Order fulfilment, stock management &amp; asset tracking</strong></p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceIncomingOrders.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceIncomingOrders-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>A key insight during this project was the importance of separating procurement (purchasing equipment) from fulfilment (distributing equipment). In many cases, Juice is actually solving a fulfilment problem since equipment is reused in the constant turn of employees.</p><br /><p>The fulfilment team configures equipment, fulfils orders, checks returned equipment and orders new stock. This is a high touch process with considerable side activities to streamline the business. For example, we consider the redirection of phone numbers and the handing out of phones with a full battery charge to be a standard part of our service. The impact on users of this is remarkable – they can walk away with a phone that is immediately ready for business. </p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceShippingAnItem.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceShippingAnItem-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Separating fulfilment from procurement allows us to aim for a 2 business day turnaround on all orders. Kits are ready for immediate shipping and stock is ordered in batches using a <a href="http://wcm.nu/Kanban/kanban.html">simple two-bin Kanban system with visual cues</a>. (Tracking stock levels in Juice is tempting, but much more complicated than visual cues.)</p><p>An order is only complete after the recipient marks it as received in Juice. This ensures that the delivery loop is closed and the user is satisfied.</p><p>Tracking kits in Juice gives us a full inventory of all equipment, along with its current owner and history of movement. This can be used for asset tracking, identifying troublesome equipment and timely upgrade of old equipment.</p><p><strong>Business impact</strong></p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceOrdersByQuarter.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceOrdersByQuarter-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>The first impression on new starters for IT and the business as a whole has been transformed. On their first day we can now hand them a computer, mobile phone, mobile broadband, etc all configured and in working order. This truly shows that we are an efficient, organised company who value your arrival and expect you to be productive. In feedback to HR, basic logistics has gone from the number one frustration of new users to the item they are most likely to raise as unprompted positive feedback.</p><p>For managers, the new starter process now requires no forms and works well regardless of the managers proactivity or experience in onboarding. This is a huge relief and reduced burden on their time.</p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKitRegister.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKitRegister-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>For day-to-day equipment purchases the adoption of Juice has been phenomenal. Within a year we’ve gone from no visibility or control of purchases to more than 180 orders being fulfilled each month. That’s 180 times each month that users can stay focused on their core job rather than worrying about equipment choices, shopping trips or doing nothing and remaining less productive.</p><p>Beyond the volume of orders, a great measure of success is the requests we’ve received to expand the catalogue into other areas. Not only did users as for data projectors to be added to the catalogue, but soon after we were asked to add a standard offering for data projector screens. High usability and simple ordering is actually driving users to request standard offerings!</p><p>For IT, Juice has increased our accountability through transparency, but it has also made it much easier for us to deliver high quality equipment on time. The process is clear, the orders are standard and our metrics are defined. Beyond that, and perhaps unexpectedly, we’ve also found the transparency has made our users more patient when we have stock delays or high demand. They can see their order is in the system and can trust that it won’t be missed or forgotten.</p><p>In short, Juice increases both control and freedom. Users have the freedom to choose which equipment best suits their needs, and control over their individual costs. IT has control of equipment standards (the menu), purchasing decisions and quality delivery.</p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKitRegisterDetailed.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKitRegisterDetailed-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p><strong>Integration &amp; next steps</strong></p><p>The Juice model of ownership, approvals and cost control is highly extensible and flexible. We’ve continued to evolve the “kits” on offer and extend the system to cover non-IT aspects of our employees needs.</p><p>Juice is the database driving the people search capabilities on <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/08/our-intranet-wiki-case-study-of-wiki.htm">JCintra</a>.</p><p>Juice is used for billing of consumable costs such as the SMS send feature of JCintra and our mobile broadband billing. In time, we will integrate per page costs for printer use and mobile phone charges.</p><p>We’re continuing to improve the processes around Juice, streamlining various activities. We automatically order name plates for head office staff and manage storage locker information for shipping of materials to field staff. In time, we will automate the ordering of things like business cards.</p><p>We will also continue to explore the capability of Juice to make other usually hidden information visible to end users. We imagine permissions and rights like signing authorities or system access controls tracked as visible assets in Juice - automatically triggering their setup for new users or revocation for leavers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceJCintraIntegration.png"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px" src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceJCintraIntegration-Thumbnail.png" /></a> <p>Juice was a low cost project that has had a large and growing impact on the day-to-day productivity of our business. The <a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/02/clarify-simplify-implement.htm">Clarify, Simplify, Implement</a> approach pushed our team to convert our delivery process, remove the barriers for users and transform the financial model.</p><p>With Juice, users and manages have the freedom to choose the service mix they need, while IT controls the provision, standards and delivery of high quality equipment. Jobs are simpler, roles are clearer and we don’t need to fight for freedom or control.</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
