title: Revving up the Google App(s) Engine
---

Google have just [announced](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/open-for-business-google-apps.html)
their [Google Apps Marketplace](http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/home),
a huge step forward for SME's and forward-looking Large Enterprises.

[Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/) is a powerful, affordable and highly
reliable infrastructure. It is delivered at a cost point that is [hard for even
the largest of enterprises to match](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2010/01/two-worlds-colliding-small-and-nimble.htm).
The Google Apps features are still a little limited relative to Microsoft
Office, but are improving all the time particularly as Google executes
consistently and aggressively on their strategy of speeding up the web (Chrome,
Chrome OS, DNS services, Caching) and driving low cost services to the cloud
(App Engine, GWT). This is [what disruptive innovation looks like](http://www.businessweek.com/chapter/christensen.htm)
- just good enough for low cost customers but quickly moving up the food chain.

Enterprises face notoriously difficult integration and usability challenges for
their systems. In recent years we've seen innovation, forward thinking and major
advances coming in the consumer space while enterprises watch helpless from
behind hard to use, expensive to configure and impossible to integrate systems.

A Google App Store for Google Apps based on the [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/)
will change this space forever.

Applications would be available for instant installation at a reasonable price.
The integration and configuration would be much simpler, as organisations live
on a predefined Google stack. (For good or bad, sometimes you just need to
choose a particular cool-aid to drink for a while.)

Developers will flock to a platform that allows simple marketing and
distribution access to SME organisations with a clear stack. It will reduce
sales cycles, increase sales opportunities and provide a green field space for
rapid improvement and innovation.

Overall, the enterprise software space will be disrupted one app at a time. It
won't start in the largest companies, it won't be immediate, but it will be
fast, continuous and drive corporate productivity to new levels.
