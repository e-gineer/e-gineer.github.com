title: "Cone of silence"
---

When out with friends, we often refer to being in a "cone of silence". The
implication is that you seem to have found a noisy spot at the table which
means you cannot hear a word of the conversation going on around you.

Turns out that the term originates from the [Get
Smart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Smart) TV series, here are [some
pictures](http://www.cinerhama.com/getsmart/innovations.html).

PS: Made my first contribution to Wikipedia today, adding a link to images from
the [Cone of Silence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Silence) entry.
