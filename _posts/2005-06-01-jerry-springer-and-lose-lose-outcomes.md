title: "Jerry Springer and lose-lose outcomes"
---

Reading my [negotiation
textbook](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131407384), I couldn't
help but think of the guests on [Jerry
Springer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Springer):
> Often, it is the mere presence of an audience that can make "saving face" of
> paramount importance for the negotiator. When a person's face is threatened in
> a negotiation, it can tip the balance of his or her behaviour away from
> cooperation toward competition, resulting in impasses and lose-lose
> outcomes.

Still, with episodes like "Daddy, will you marry me?" I guess lose-lose is inevitable.
