title: "Glimpses of big change in Office 12"
---

About 2am last night I was about to crash when I stumbled upon this [video
demo](http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=114720) of the Office 12
UI. Wow! I'm really impressed with the guts to make changes on this scale and
think the results look great. IMO, [the
screenshots](http://bink.nu/Article4818.bink) don't do the changes justice at
all.

Watching people struggle with various Office programs through
an MBA, the more adept users normally just sigh and take control of document
creation or clean up. So any changes that make the capabilities easier to
access or explain is a good thing.

It was also great to hear how
much useful information Microsoft gathers from their customer experience
program. For example, around 70-90% of clicks in Word are on the standard
toolbar.

It's interesting to see that Review has been raised in
importance to having it's own top level Tab in the Ribbon UI. This gels with
the apparent focus on team authoring in Office 12, building on the success of
Sharepoint which was strongly integrated in Office 2003. For Office 11, the
Sharepoint team was moved into the Office team. For Office 12, the Content
Management Server team was moved into the Office team [as
well](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/microsoft/ms-cms-and-ms-sharepoint-merging-architectures-000639.php).
On top of that, [Groove](http://www.groove.net/) has been added to Microsoft
over the previous year.

With Office 2003, Sharepoint was added to
the mix. Over the last 3 years it's grown massively in popularity for Intranet
solutions. Office 12 will take a while to filter through, but I'm expecting
dramatic changes to the enterprise content and workflow landscape.
