title: "RSS is sticky traffic"
---

In the old web days, a spike of new traffic to your website was normally just
that, a spike. After the initial interest had died down the general traffic
averages would return pretty much to normal.

An interesting
characteristic of RSS is that the traffic is sticky. Once someone discovers
your site is interesting and subscribes to your feed, they effectively never
leave. This results in a constant upward trend for your traffic statistics.

I wonder what interesting statistics or views we could get of RSS data
from the web server? For example, average number of requests / IP address /
day; % of requests that returned 304 Not Modified; graph of the length of time
it takes for a feed update to reach a majority or readers; subscribers gained
in the last month; subscribers lost in the last month; etc.
