Working long hours, it was common for us to do washing of a weeknight and put
on the dryer while going to sleep. But our downstairs neighbour seems to be an
insomniac and likes to blame our dryer (among other things).

The
most memorable disagreement was the first night that she buzzed us to complain
about 10:50pm. I argued back and refused to turn it off until the clothes were
dry.

This may seem unreasonable, but we've never heard any noise
from any other apartment in 2 years. Also, we'd kindly let her in late one
other night a few months earlier to search for a noise that was keeping her
awake (not in our apartment).

Anyway, about 20 minutes later I felt
guilty and the clothes were pretty much dry so I turned off the dryer.

Then at about 12:30am our apartment buzzer rang again, waking me up. Still
annoyed, I answered the apartment buzzer with "What?!?". "Ah, sir, it's the
police. Would you mind coming down?". So, I was woken up by a noise complaint
follow up from the police. To be honest, I'm not sure either the cops or I knew
how to handle it.

I'd love to do a full noise level analysis to
check that we're definitely within the [NSW noise
guidelines](http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/noise/neighbourhoodnoise.htm), especially
since dryers aren't even listed as a potential problem source. But
unfortunately, I don't have access to a noise level meter.
