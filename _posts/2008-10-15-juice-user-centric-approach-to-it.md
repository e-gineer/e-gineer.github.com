## Introduction

A smooth new starter process and
good day-to-day management of equipment are essential to the reputation and
operation of all IT departments.

Traditionally, this is a never-ending
cycle of standards, policies, delivery and backend information collection (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMDB">CMDB</a>). Frustrated users end up
expensing high cost, non-standard equipment and building <a
href="http://mikeschaffner.typepad.com/michael_schaffner/2007/01/we_need_more_sh.html">shadow
IT</a> solutions.

Determined to find a better way, we started a project
with 3 aims:
1. It should be easier to buy something internally than externally.
2. Equipment orders and new starters are always urgent, so make that the default case.
3. IT needs macro-level control of standards and procurement. Users and managers need micro-level control of equipment and cost-benefit decisions.

With one person working on the process and
another working on the system development, within 4 months we launched Juice.
This case study presents our journey and results 12 months after launch,
recognised by our <a
href="http://www.steptwo.com.au/products/iia2008/winners">Gold award in the
Business Solutions category of the 2008 Intranet Innovation
Awards</a>.

## Before Juice

<a href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKits.png"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px;
MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKits-Thumbnail.png" /></a>

High level standards were in place (e.g. Dell D630 laptop), but low level
customisation was allowed (e.g. 4GB RAM instead of standard 2GB) leading to a
wide range of parts and supported systems.  With standards control and
provision approval, ad-hoc decisions were continually required by IT as to what
equipment should be supplied to individual users, for example, does this user
do enough travel to justify a light-weight laptop? (Of course, in the end users
work out to play the <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/Business+Entry+Point/Business+Topics/Occupational+health+and+safety/">OH&amp;S</a>
card and get what they want.)

Processes were designed for the best case
(knowing weeks in advance about new starters), not the usual case (they start
tomorrow). New equipment orders were placed as required, with a lead time of
weeks to delivery and deployment. In addition, equipment was owned by and
depreciated to individual cost centres throughout the business. This
combination fostered a high level of ownership, but lead to protectionism,
non-compliance, misallocation of costs and wasted resources as equipment sat
in cupboards as departments tried to ensure a smooth entry for new
starters.

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceCatalog.png"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;
BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceCatalog-Thumbnail.png"
/></a> 

This ad-hoc ownership and provision meant that broken equipment
endured long downtime periods, particularly for remote users, as it was
returned, fixed and then sent back. For new starters, equipment like PDA’s
may even passed directly from ex-employees to new employees with no review,
training or quality check. 

Things worked before Juice, because
everyone cared about the end user and worked hard to deliver. But, everyone
was frustrated, spot fires were common and a lot of excess effort was
required to make things run smoothly.

## Managing equipment as kits

All equipment is now defined in kit form. For example:
Dell D630 Laptop, BlackBerry 8100 Pearl, Lenovo 20" monitor docking
station.

Each kit may have a number of accessories. For example: The
Dell D630 Laptop includes a mouse, battery, carry bag, power pack and network
cable. Whether they are new or previously used, shipped kits always include
exactly those accessories. We chose to remove printed manuals, software CD's,
etc.

Lost or broken accessories may be individually replaced through
single-click ordering. No approval is required as they are cheap and
considered essential to the functioning of the kit. If a kit is returned
incomplete, we simply charge the user for any missing accessories.

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceViewAKit.png"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px;
MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceViewAKit-Thumbnail.png"
/></a>

Each kit has a key item (e.g. the laptop itself). If that item is
lost, stolen or broken then the entire kit is replaced. For example, we will
send a completely new laptop kit including all accessories and ask for the
old laptop / accessories to be returned.  This ensures that we are always
shipping kits complete and tested.

Where possible we use a "swap &amp; repair" model to deal with problematic equipment and minimise downtime. For
example, if a user is having trouble with their PDA we simply configure a new
one and send it out immediately. The old PDA is then returned, repaired and
reused in the future by another user.

This kit-based approach is highly
flexible and allows the system to move beyond IT. We also track corporate
credit cards, phone numbers and storage lockers as kits in
Juice.

## The financial model

We decided that
departments must control their own costs, while IT provides standards,
service and guidance. If IT is a gatekeeper to individual needs and owns
costs we'll always be crushed by low level decisions, limiting the business
with strict policies and eventually worked around through shadow IT or
creative business / safety / any reasoning.

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceActivityTracking.png"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;
BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceActivityTracking-Thumbnail.png"
/></a> 

Instead, IT must control the standards, options and service. While
users and managers must own the cost and have the freedom to make personal
equipment choices.

As such, in Juice all equipment is purchased, owned
and depreciated by the IT department. Based on the cost and useful life of
each kit, they are leased to users at a fixed daily rate. This has a number
of advantages:
* Equipment can be optimally moved between departments and users. (Items owned by individuals are heavily protected and difficult to relocate.)
* Equipment moves from a hidden, uncontrollable cost (depreciation) to a controllable IT cost charged monthly. Managers can now engage in a conversation on how to reduce their IT costs or get better value for money.
* Equipment is only required for active users &amp; a buffer, so less capital is tied up in equipment for vacant positions.
* Users only pay for a kit while they are using it. This encourages the reuse and return of equipment, and encourages IT to maintain the lowest possible inventory that meets service standards.

If a
kit is lost, broken or stolen the residual value is charged to the owner's
cost centre. While harsh in some cases, this provides encouragement to
properly care for and safeguard equipment at all times.

If a user
chooses to replace or upgrade a kit, they pay half the residual value of the
kit they currently own. (This is a deterrent to upgrading early, but also
discourages people from just reporting the kit as lost or broken.)

In
the end, IT owns macro-level standards, cost control and service levels.
Users own micro-level decisions, needs and cost-benefit choices.

src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuicePlaceAnOrder-Thumbnail.png"
/></a>

## Approvals and workflow

New kits (e.g. I need
a data projector), kit upgrades (e.g. I want a lightweight laptop), or kit
replacements (e.g. I lost my PDA) require manager approval. This single step
workflow is fast, effective and completed by the cost centre
owner.

Replacement accessories do not require any approval, they are
considered essential to keep the kit in good working order and charged
immediately to your team cost centre. For transparency, these charges do
appear in the managers monthly bill.

Users and managers have freedom,
transparency and accountability for their purchase decisions and costs. IT
has no involvement in these approval or workflow stages, we are not a
gatekeeper. Our job is to maintain an appropriate menu of equipment, agree
recommendations of standard kits per role and to provide high quality
equipment, service and training.

## Onboarding &amp; Offboarding

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceTeam.png"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;
BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceTeam-Thumbnail.png" /></a>


Without good people control, you cannot have good asset or equipment
  control.

Juice synchronises each night with our HR system, detecting
  any additions, reductions or changes to the organisation structure. Juice
  also stores a position hierarchy for the business, including predefined
  employee types with standard equipment. We synchronise the HR changes with
  the position structure to create appropriate orders in the system.

As a
  result, we have no new starter forms for IT.  This is a huge improvement from
  forms requesting accounts, ad-hoc requests for security access and equipment
  orders done on a person-by-person basis. For managers, the work has
  dramatically reduced. For new starters, the process is far more
  reliable.

Juice also stores cost centre and team information, inherited
  down through the organisational tree. With this information, Juice simplifies
  approvals and allocates charge backs.

## Order fulfilment, stock management &amp; asset tracking

<a
  href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceIncomingOrders.png"><img
  style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px;
  MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
  src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceIncomingOrders-Thumbnail.png"
  /></a> 

A key insight during this project was the importance of separating
  procurement (purchasing equipment) from fulfilment (distributing equipment).
  In many cases, Juice is actually solving a fulfilment problem since equipment
  is reused in the constant turn of employees.<br />

The fulfilment team
  configures equipment, fulfils orders, checks returned equipment and orders
  new stock. This is a high touch process with considerable side activities to
  streamline the business. For example, we consider the redirection of phone
  numbers and the handing out of phones with a full battery charge to be a
  standard part of our service. The impact on users of this is remarkable –
  they can walk away with a phone that is immediately ready for business.

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceShippingAnItem.png"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;
BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceShippingAnItem-Thumbnail.png"
/></a> 

Separating fulfilment from procurement allows us to aim for a 2
  business day turnaround on all orders. Kits are ready for immediate shipping
  and stock is ordered in batches using a <a
  href="http://wcm.nu/Kanban/kanban.html">simple two-bin Kanban system with
  visual cues</a>. (Tracking stock levels in Juice is tempting, but much more
  complicated than visual cues.)

An order is only complete after the
  recipient marks it as received in Juice. This ensures that the delivery loop
  is closed and the user is satisfied.

Tracking kits in Juice gives us a
  full inventory of all equipment, along with its current owner and history of
  movement. This can be used for asset tracking, identifying troublesome
  equipment and timely upgrade of old equipment.

## Business impact

<a
  href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceOrdersByQuarter.png"><img
  style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;

  src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceOrdersByQuarter-Thumbnail.png"
  /></a> 

The first impression on new starters for IT and the business as a
  whole has been transformed. On their first day we can now hand them a
  computer, mobile phone, mobile broadband, etc all configured and in working
  order. This truly shows that we are an efficient, organised company who value
  your arrival and expect you to be productive. In feedback to HR, basic
  logistics has gone from the number one frustration of new users to the item
  they are most likely to raise as unprompted positive feedback.

For
  managers, the new starter process now requires no forms and works well
  regardless of the managers proactivity or experience in onboarding. This is a
  huge relief and reduced burden on their time.<a
  href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceKitRegister.png"><img
  style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT: 0px;
  MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"

  /></a> 

For day-to-day equipment purchases the adoption of Juice has been
  phenomenal. Within a year we’ve gone from no visibility or control of
  purchases to more than 180 orders being fulfilled each month. That’s 180
  times each month that users can stay focused on their core job rather than
  worrying about equipment choices, shopping trips or doing nothing and
  remaining less productive.

Beyond the volume of orders, a great measure
  of success is the requests we’ve received to expand the catalogue into other
  areas. Not only did users as for data projectors to be added to the
  catalogue, but soon after we were asked to add a standard offering for data
  projector screens. High usability and simple ordering is actually driving
  users to request standard offerings!

For IT, Juice has increased our
  accountability through transparency, but it has also made it much easier for
  us to deliver high quality equipment on time.  The process is clear, the
  orders are standard and our metrics are defined. Beyond that, and perhaps
  unexpectedly, we’ve also found the transparency has made our users more
  patient when we have stock delays or high demand. They can see their order is
  in the system and can trust that it won’t be missed or forgotten.

In
  short, Juice increases both control and freedom. Users have the freedom to
  choose which equipment best suits their needs, and control over their
  individual costs. IT has control of equipment standards (the menu),
  purchasing decisions and quality delivery.<a

  /></a> 

## Integration &amp; next steps

The Juice model
  of ownership, approvals and cost control is highly extensible and flexible.
  We’ve continued to evolve the “kits” on offer and extend the system to cover
  non-IT aspects of our employees needs.

Juice is the database driving
  the people search capabilities on <a
  href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/08/our-intranet-wiki-case-study-of-wiki.htm">JCintra</a>.

Juice
  is used for billing of consumable costs such as the SMS send feature of
  JCintra and our mobile broadband billing. In time, we will integrate per page
  costs for printer use and mobile phone charges.

We’re continuing to
  improve the processes around Juice, streamlining various activities. We
  automatically order name plates for head office staff and manage storage
  locker information for shipping of materials to field staff. In time, we will
  automate the ordering of things like business cards.

We will also
  continue to explore the capability of Juice to make other usually hidden
  information visible to end users. We imagine permissions and rights like
  signing authorities or system access controls tracked as visible assets in
  Juice - automatically triggering their setup for new users or revocation for
  leavers.

## Conclusion

<a
  href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/10/JuiceJCintraIntegration.png"><img

Juice was a low cost project that has had a large and growing
  impact on the day-to-day productivity of our business. The <a
  href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2008/02/clarify-simplify-implement.htm">Clarify,
  Simplify, Implement</a> approach pushed our team to convert our delivery
  process, remove the barriers for users and transform the financial
  model.

With Juice, users and manages have the freedom to choose the
  service mix they need, while IT controls the provision, standards and
  delivery of high quality equipment. Jobs are simpler, roles are clearer and
  we don’t need to fight for freedom or control.
