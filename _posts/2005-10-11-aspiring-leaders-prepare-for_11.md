title: "Aspiring leaders prepare for opportunity"
---

Over the weekend, in a Leadership &amp; Motivation MBA course, we had a
number of interesting discussions about what it takes to be a great leader.
Many ideas were tossed around including drive, luck, ambition, charisma and
much more.

Through discussion, our group boiled it down to this simple
model:

> Leadership performance = Ability x Motivation x Alignment x Opportunity

In reality, this is just a slight variation of
[Vroom's 1964 model](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0787900303)
for performance at work:

> Performance = Ability x Motivation<br/>
> Performance = (Aptitude x Training x Resources) x (Desire x Commitment)

The fundamental difference being that work normally provides you with a context
of tasks or opportunity by default while great leaders normally arise out of
new opportunities (thrust upon them, created or sought out). For us,
opportunity incorporates luck, timing and preparation.

A guest lecturer, Harry Bergsteiner, likes to expand Vroom's model to include
Values:

> Performance = Ability x Motivation x Values

In this context, Values includes ethics, policies, procedures and corporate
culture. His argument is that the alignment of someone's values with those of
the organisation is very important to performance. Interestingly, he also
points out that the only place where punishment or sanctions of staff make
sense is when values are not met. Any ability or motivation issues need to be
addressed through feedback, encouragement and training. Personally I think that
Values is a little bit too idealistic and universal. For mine, it makes more
sense to talk about this as alignment with the values of the
organisation.

> Performance = Ability x Motivation x Alignment

Part of leadership is choosing, building and communicating appropriate values
for an organisation (followers). Here alignment remains a vital element to
success, both upwards (personal alignment with larger organisation values)
and downwards (bring followers into alignment). So, the performance of a
leader boils down to:

> Leadership performance = Ability x Motivation x Alignment x Opportunity

According to Winston Churchill, "Luck is what happens when preparation meets
opportunity". So, if you have the motivation, keep preparing and looking for
the opportunity that aligns with your values.
