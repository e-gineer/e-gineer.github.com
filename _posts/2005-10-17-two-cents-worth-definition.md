title: "Two cents worth, a definition"
---

After dropping "That's my $0.02." into an email for a multi-cultural uni group
today, I was asked what it meant. Finding a
[definition](http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxputino.html) was
surprisingly difficult, but I did stumble across a forum with [this little
gem](http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/40/messages/446.html) on the
way:

> *The phrase "2 cents" does often be found in emails and some other situations. What does this phrase mean?*
> 
> I believe the
> complete phrase you want is "two cents' worth," but often shortened to "two
> cents," as in, "Can I put in my two cents here?" Two cents is, in the U.S., two
> pennies, a very small sum of money. Even in "the old days," two pennies were
> considered not worth much. So my opinion, which may not be worth much, is "my
> two cents' worth."
> 
> *If its "My 2 cents worth" and "A penny for your thoughts", where does the other penny go?*
> 
> That's the penny that dropped.
