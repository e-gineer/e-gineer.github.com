title: Rediscovering e-gineer through blogging
---

Like most things in my life, e-gineer morphed to become part of Synop as it
formed. Then, like many other things, it was heavily neglected as Synop grew
and changed.

With Synop coming to a close, this is an ideal time to reclaim e-gineer and use
it as a basis for rebuilding my personal IT infrastructure and sense of self.
(It's an indication of my high level of nerdiness that my sense of self is
intertwined with a web site and email address). Having spent 7 years designing
and building CMS software, it's only natural that I decided to come up with a
framework for e-gineer that should help it survive a lifetime of personal
change, neglect and rediscovery. I'll be describing this in more detail through
a series of posts about Personal IT.

It's traditional for a first blog post to make promises, build anticipation and
represent a burst of enthusiasm. Since most blogs start with no readers, I
guess it doesn't really matter. Anyway, here is what to expect from this
blog:
* Posts made in infrequent bursts. The great thing about RSS is that it costs readers nothing to continually check for new content from irregular authors.
* A wide ranging set of topics. Focus is nice, but this is a personal weblog that I'm taking on my journey into entrepreneurship.  Who knows where we'll end up?
* Honesty and openness, to a point. I prefer conversations with substance to smalltalk, and seem to quickly end up in deep discussions with new aquaintances. But, this is the web and everything I say can be stored, archived and referenced for all time. So, I'll hopefully say enough to be interesting without going too far.

Of course, the only important outcome for any blogger is to find your voice.
