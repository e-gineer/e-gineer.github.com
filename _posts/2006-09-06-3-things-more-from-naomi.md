It's hard when all of the talent and the good looks in the family go to one
of your siblings. The songs below are all composed and performed by my sister
Naomi Wallace, recorded at home using
[GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/).

3 Things was written as a wedding gift to Bianca and I,
so clearly it's my favourite.

    <div class="blogCommentBody">Such a lovely lady, and a lovely voice.  I saw her on &#39;Wiggle Bay&#39;, which is one of my son&#39;s favorites.  Does she have any upcoming film or TV roles?  Her own site?</div>
