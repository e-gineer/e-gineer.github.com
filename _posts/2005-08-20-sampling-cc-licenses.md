title: "Sampling the CC licenses"
---

I think the Creative Commons system of licenses is great. They are simple,
clear and direct. Unfortunately, I've struggled to find a license that I feel
is suitable for the e-gineer site.

I encourage people to link to
this site. I encourage people to build on my ideas and work. But, I don't want
people distributing complete copies of my work on e-gineer, commercial or
otherwise.

I'm surprised that Creative Commons haven't created a
license format to represent the standard / implicit copyright case. I
understand it's implied and may even be against the spirit of CC, but surely it
would make sense to provide it with all the machine and human readable
capabilities they've managed to bring to the more sharing friendly licenses? If
anything, it would encourage the use and awareness of the CC license format and
ability software tools to use it more widely?

Anyway, as best I can
tell, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling/1.0/">Sampling
license</a> is the most appropriate for my needs.

My understanding
of clause 6a in the license is that once used on a work that work can be used
subject to those terms perpetually, regardless of whether you change the
license. I'm certainly not expecting a flood of users, but I guess that means
it's important to choose carefully before using a license. So, for now,
everything here remains under the implicit (no need to even Â© it) copyright
license.
