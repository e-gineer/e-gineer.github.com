Watching Dave Winer on [NerdTV](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/) last
night I was struck by [one
section](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/transcripts/006.html) in
particular:

The mysterious Mr Gutman posted [very similar
ideas](http://mrgutman.blogspot.com/2005/06/second-time-entrepreneurs.html) a
few months ago, drawing a [response from
Ev](http://evhead.com/2005/06/mr-gutman-second-time-entrepreneurs.asp) (a
Blogger founder):

All the feelings and sentiments in these posts ring true for me, but I think it
all boils down to a feeling of wanting to "do it right" the second time round.
Starting a business is more than just a learning curve, it's getting beat over
the head with a learning stick. Through daily decisions and drawing lines of
grey you learn about your boundaries, strengths and weaknesses.

I believe it's about focused energy. Start-ups have very limited capital, time
and skills. The tighter your focus, the further you can progress with the
limited resources available. Unfortunately, this is incredibly hard to do in
the whirlwind of chasing new ideas and customers. 

Great start-ups should be like having a baby. No matter how tired you are, or
how much attention it requires, the joy and rewards are worth it<sup>2</sup>.

1. Bend over and grease up - see #19 [here](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/26.html).
2. Or so I'm told by people who actually have children (or canine psuedo-children).
