title: "GPL3 to close a loophole"
---

Many years ago I was a keen user of the Arsdigita Community System. Coming
out of MIT, it was licensed under the GPL. This [worried me a
little](http://ccm.redhat.com/bboard-archive/webdb/0005gE.html):

> As I understand it, the GPL states that any work derived from
> the GPL'ed work also comes under the terms of the GPL. Doesn't that mean that

The response was a very direct "don't
worry about it", sensibly trying to shut down any concerns or worries of users
and their customers. But, his answer also showed a misunderstanding of the GPL
and the general loose care factor at the time about using
it:

> I'm not a lawyer. I just have an office down the hall from Richard Stallman's so I used his license...
> I'm too busy programming the next release to worry too much about legal stuff...

But, under the [changes proposed to the
GPL3](http://news.com.com/GPL+3+may+tackle+Web+loophole/2100-7344_3-5884172.html?tag=nefd.hed)
to "close a loophole" I suspect we'll have no choice but to
worry.

Developers and website administrators have to be very careful
about the software licenses they don't read. The "I'm not a lawyer" argument
just won't hold up in court.
