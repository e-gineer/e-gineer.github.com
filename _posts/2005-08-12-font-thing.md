Trawling through thousands of fonts is an important process when
creating logos. The right font can make all the difference. I'm still very
happy with the Synop logo after all these years, I believe it was
timeless.

Found this great, free, Australian utility yesterday for
looking through fonts that are in a directory, but not installed. Go get [the
font thing](http://members.ozemail.com.au/~scef/tft.html).
