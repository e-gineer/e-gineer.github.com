title: "eBay, myths and the bottom-up economy"
---

[eBay's](http://www.ebay.com) origins as a site built by Pierre Omidyar so
his fiance could trade Pez dispensers is well known. It's old news, but I
learned last night that this is actually [a brilliant PR
myth](http://www.ecommercetimes.com/perl/story/19221.html) created by Mary Lou
Song.

Myths, stories and legends are vital for company culture and to
create a mystic that attracts outsiders. The eBay myth is an inspiring example
of how a good story (true or false) can connect a company with its customers in
a very real way.

eBay is an expert at understanding the importance of
customer relationships on their business, they embody [the bottom-up
economy](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/01/15/fortune.ff.bottomup.econ/):

> In the bottom-up economy, presuming you know what the customer wants is the
> ultimate error. Prahalad and Ramaswamy instead call for "co-creation of value":
> The successful products and services from now on will be those developed
> jointly -- company and customer working hand in hand. 
> 
> To Pierre Omidyar
> all that sounds very familiar. As the founder of eBay, he is the Adam Smith of
> the Bottom-Up Economy. From the beginning, eBay set out to level the playing
> field between big and small. 
> 
> Says he: "At eBay the managers don't
> control the brand or the customer experience -- our customers themselves do."
> 
> Scary. But then, eBay's $42 billion market cap suggests that the
> benefits of working bottom-up make it worth the
> risks.
