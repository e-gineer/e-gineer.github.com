title: ADSL in the fast lane
---

After weeks of pain in the bad old days of dial up, our new ADSL connection
finally went live yesterday. It's amazing how a few weeks of dial up completely
changed our habits: buying the paper for a TV guide, not checking email at
night, wireless laptop never leaving the study.

Using [iiNet](http://www.iinet.net.au) broadband starter we have up to 1Mb/8Mb
speeds with 4GB of data download a month for $39.95. Our apartment connection
seems to be line synching at about 0.8Mb/2.3Mb which is a little disappointing,
but not unexpected.

So far the speed seems to be highly variable, but is absolutely flying
throughout the day. Even late last night things were particularly slow. I'll
give it a few days to settle in. For real numbers, the [Oz Broadband Speed
Test](http://members.optusnet.com.au/djalexm/speedtest/) is helpful. We get
about 200kB/sec real usage speed. When it works, it's great!


Of course, in Australia the extra speed isn't always noticable as it seems that
most connections to US websites don't run much faster anyway.  I don't know
where the bottleneck is for these, but I guess that's the beauty of the
seamless connectivity / complexity of the Internet.  Everyone can blame someone
else.

PS: Using our Alcatel Speedtouch modem I could get the line synch speed through
a lot of fiddling around to access the web interface
([http://10.0.0.138](http://10.0.0.138)).
