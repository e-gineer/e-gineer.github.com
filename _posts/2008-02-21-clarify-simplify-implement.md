Working through a wide range of projects,
our IT team has settled into a consistent project methodology: <em>Clarify,
Simplify, Implement</em>.

Clarify: Work with key stakeholders to
understand drivers behind the process. Question motives and key assumptions.
Turn over all the rocks to see what lies underneath. (In traditional software
terms, this is requirements gathering.)

Simplify: Relentlessly question,
review and challenge the processes and solution being developed. Drive for
consistency. Search for well-known models or applications you can copy. Don't
be afraid to change basic assumptions, where simplicity can be enhanced. Always
challenge the value of edge cases and try to eradicate them. Work hard to
remove every single process, click, page view, icon, etc until you have
something so simple that it feels right to everyone involved. (This is the
primary value adding activity for IT.)

Implement: After the requirements
are clear, and the solution distilled to its simplest form, start implementing.
Do not start with a preconceived solution. Continue to loop through clarify and
simplify while performing the implementation. (Use your preferred development
methodology, provided it supports constant change and rapid
prototyping.)

## Tough love adds value

Consultants
can gather requirements, and programmers can deliver code from anywhere in the
world. But, tough love is only available from those you know and trust. This is
the advantage and importance that internal IT teams offer.

External
service providers make money through complexity and increased scope. It's in
their interest to understand your desires, validate them and then do more work
to deliver the wish list. IT needs to reject this model, and help prevent the
organisation from becoming as complex as it constantly tries to
be.

Simplicity is making hard decisions up front so users can save time
and effort in every interaction for all time. Assumptions must be challenged.
The status quo should not be accepted as always correct. Trade offs must not be
avoided.

Tough love and simplification change IT from a human power tool
into a true business partner who provides both leadership and support. Tough
love is different to just being tough, it includes love. IT should never be a
blocker and will occasionally need to be forgiving. IT should be open in
communication and have the best interests of the business at
heart.

## Design reviews: Brutal refinement and pixel-perfect goodness

An essential part of Clarify, Simplify, Implement are
design reviews. These form the ongoing basis for a loop of improvement beyond
the initial pass of requirements gathering, simplification and
implementation.

A design review includes the application/process owner,
the key implementation team and a set of trusted peers. They systematically
move through and challenge every process, screen, button, decision, layout and
definition. Pixel alignment is important. Removing every excess user decision
and superfulous design element matters. Entire pieces of the process or
application may need to be redesigned or thrown out. Consistency is
critical.

Design reviews are hard and tiring, but ultimately hugely
rewarding. Project deadlines and a desire to move onto new problems make it
hard to continually refactor your solution design and implementation. It's
tempting to stop at good enough, when great is just around the corner. Hours
spent discussing alternative user interfaces and nitpicking over definitions
can seem like wasted or unproductive time, particularly when your not sure if
anyone will notice.

Design reviews take good solutions and make them
great.

## Zero training

Every user is time poor. They
have no interest or time for attending training sessions. Training is the first
and biggest hurdle to adoption of your new system and process. While complexity
exists and training is required, users can always reject or work around the
process with a politically acceptable excuse - "It's too hard".

Our aim,
through simplification, is to make people's life easier, reduce the burden on
their time and remove all the excuses. The reward is adoption, engagement and
relief that that finally it's been done the way everyone always thought
(individually) it should be.

## Staying simple

After launch, when everyone loves the new system
because it just seems to easy, is when discipline becomes truly critical.
Feature requests, small changes and extensions will flow from users and every
single one "should be easy to add". The hard part is deciding which requests
are worthy while ensuring that the system remains simple and
consistent.

## Clear, simple solutions challenge traditional project economics

With a robust process of clarification and
simplication, two things happen:
1. The implementation phase is much easier. (e.g. multi-step, parallel workflow problems become one level approval).
2. The solution becomes very agile and iterative, since it's only through the project process that new clarifications and simplifications become apparent.

Traditional enterprise software projects start
with large, feature rich solutions that cover the complexity of features and
organisational behaviour that appear to be "requirements". Clarify, Simplify,
Implement refuses to engage in projects until the status quo has been
challenged leading to changes or understanding.

For example, we recently
set ourselves the IT procurement challenge that "it should be easier to buy
something internally than it is externally". On our journey to achieving this,
the obvious first step was inclusion of a shopping cart (we were using Amazon
as a benchmark). But, when we saw it working we realised that using enterprise
context (e.g. cost centres tied to individuals using single sign on) we didn't
even need the complexity of a cart. One click ordering is now the default
process.

Project economics and style change to become:
1. Focused on user experience. All projects and features must provide a significant improvement to the user experience or process. If the cost of implementation outweighs that improvement, then keep looking for a simpler approach that is not so expensive to produce.
2. Just in time development and design.  Accept that clarity and simplicity are a journey, no one has the vision to see that far in advance. Be disciplined enough to realise that sometimes small feature additions need large architectural change just to keep the overall application as simple and consistent as possible.
3. Optimised for lifetime value. The cost of an application must include the cost to end users of training, inconvenience and usage. For example, the cost of implementing single sign on must be compared to the cost of X users performing Y logins over Z years.

Small, simple projects are fast to prototype, easy to
justify and responsive to business needs. Combining Clarify, Simplify,
Implement with an iterative improvement process like the <a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/08/continuous-application-release-cycle.htm">Continuous
Application Release Cycle</a> sets a journey of positive dissatisfaction and
continuous improvement that will quickly change your organisation for the
better.

## Take the time to write short letters

Lack
of time, politics and ego drive enterprises towards complexity. Complex
solutions reflect our perception of the difficulty of our jobs, they reflect
the important differences of every department involved and are an inevitable
result of looking for quick wins by not challenging ourselves upfront.

As
<a
href="http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i_didn-t_have_time_to_write_a_short_letter-so_i/338386.html">Mark
Twain</a> once wrote "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a
long one instead".

Unfortunately, most project teams take this approach,
saving on delivery time and hard conversations and effectively hiding lifetime
project costs in lost productivity, frustration and training
courses.

Clarify, Simplify, Implement challenges this process and demands
the writing of short letters. Users will thank you for it.
