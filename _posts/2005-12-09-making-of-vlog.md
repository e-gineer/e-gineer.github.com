title: "The making of vlog"
---

This is a 10 minute video blog and screencast detailing the entire vlog making
process from filming to publication. It's a simple tutorial for beginners
requiring only a digital video camera, [Windows Movie
Maker](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/default.mspx) and
[Blogger](http://www.blogger.com).

The [resulting
video](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2005/12/vlog-in-vlog-about-vlog.htm) is
in line with my [15 second
approach](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2005/06/15s-of-fame.htm).
