In December, I accepted a job as an "Information Management Manager" for
[Janssen-Cilag](http://www.janssen-cilag.com/), a pharmaceutical subsidiary of
[Johnson &amp; Johnson](http://www.jnj.com/). Primarily, my time will be spent
scoping, designing and running implementation projects for a wide range of
information management systems.

After pouring so much energy and time into
[Synop](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2005/08/unofficial-history-of-synop.htm),
and loving every minute of it, the decision of what to do next was very
difficult. In the end, my decision came down to two things: emotional energy
and inflection points.

Starting a company requires a huge level of commitment, self-belief and
emotional energy. So close to the Synop experience, and with a lot less naivety
to hide behind, I didn't feel ready to jump back in.

Starting Synop straight out of uni, my career has been dominated by the
entrepreneurial experience. But, despite doubts about my ability to handle the
frustration, my interest in the corporate world has always been strong.  This
was the perfect time for a complete change and it was only going to get harder
to make the switch later.

So far, I'm loving it.
