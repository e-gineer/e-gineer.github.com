title: "Organising and storing tax receipts"

Tax receipts must be kept, but the chances of ever needing to access them again
are very low. This suggests a storage system that prioritises the speed of
adding receipts over the speed of finding them. It should be simple and
reliable in the long term tax receipt time frame. We currently track all
expenditure in [Quicken](http://www.quicken.com), so it will mostly be a
process of cross-checking for the physical paper record when required.

When keeping tax receipts be sure to discard any non-tax receipts. One of the
rules I was taught by [NSW State Records](http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/) was
to keep only important information, otherwise it gets lost in the sea of
unneeded archive data.

I've decided to use an expandable folder and place all receipts in there by
date. Each slot will be for about 6 months worth of receipts, with one folder
holding about 10 years. After that time, they are no longer required for tax
purposes and we can remove older receipts and cycle through the folder slots
again. The folder is quick to reference, easy to store receipts in, and the
enclosed nature means it's very unlikely to spill receipts out.

At [Synop](http://www.synop.com), we used a lever arch folder with a section
for each person. Expense receipts were stuck onto loose leaf pages in your
section. Stored in a public place, this made expenditure transparent and was
a simple system for both staff and our book keeper. This system is a little
slower for adding receipts, but that's justified by the book keeper reading
and the transparency benefits.

I'm undecided at this stage as to whether Bianca and I should have different
yearly slots. We are already dividing the expenditure by person in Quicken, so
it wouldn't add new information to the system but might make access faster. I'm
going to combine them for now, but will separate if we seem to be keeping a lot
of receipts.
