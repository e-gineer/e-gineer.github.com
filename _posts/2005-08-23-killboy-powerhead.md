Just a quick glimpse at some of the impressive [infrastructure
work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epping_to_Chatswood_Line,_Sydney) going on
around [Chatswood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatswood)
[station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatswood_railway_station,_Sydney) at
the moment.

Confession: While I don't plan to make it a habit, this video has two camera
shots and is about 1 second longer than
[normal](/v2/blog/2005/06/15s-of-fame.htm).
