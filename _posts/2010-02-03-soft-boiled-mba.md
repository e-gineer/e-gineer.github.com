title: A soft boiled MBA
---

After finishing my [MBA at MGSM](http://www.gsm.mq.edu.au/) back in 2005 I'm
finally ready to talk about it...

I did 16 subjects, 16 exams, 16 groups, ~48 assignments, thousands of pages of
reading. I recall almost none of it.

But, as a result of my MBA, I am self-aware of my style in groups, confident in
my breadth of knowledge and able to see business from different view points. I
can [make hard decisions](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2005/08/unofficial-history-of-synop.htm)
more easily and am comfortable finding a balance between performance, friendship
and opinions.

Oh, and having the piece of paper doesn't hurt either.
