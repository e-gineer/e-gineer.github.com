title: Corporate Alumni - Pretend they never leave
---

As much as we'd like them to stay, it's irrational to think that good people
won't leave the company. The timing of internal opportunities may be out of
alignment with their readiness. They may have family commitments. They may just
need a change.

The trick is to pretend that they never left, and treat this change as simply a
small step on their career journey. Good people will respect and value this
approach, choose to stay because you are placing their interests at heart and
highly likely return even if they have to leave now.

Build touchstones into their life connecting them to your company and reminding
them to come home again soon. Stay in contact with your alumni through Christmas
letters and gifts, encouraging them to keep their contact details up to date.
Create an equivalent of the Australian Baggy Green cricket cap, a proudly
displayed and hard won symbol of their time with the company.

Contact alumni at set intervals to inquire about their career and plans for the
future. Offer development planning opportunities, even if they don't involve a
return to your business yet. Show an interest and a passion in their future
growth and be honest about true opportunities you may have (or not) for them.

Use your alumni network for job referrals, paying a similar bonus as that paid
to internal employees for finding new hires. This keeps the connection,
provides an incentive and reminds alumni in a low pressure way that you have
ongoing opportunities that may interest them. It also ensures referrals are
coming from people who know your business well.

Alumni are like friends living overseas. They are hard to stay in touch with,
but one day they'll move back and we want to pick up right where we left off.

If you love something, set it free.

						<div class="blogCommentBody">100% agree. Now the company just needs to the will to implement something like this. I&#39;m sure that you would find that it would pay dividends over the years.</div>
