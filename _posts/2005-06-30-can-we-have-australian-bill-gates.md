title: "Can we have an Australian Bill Gates?"
---

[Steve Balmer](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/default.mspx) was
the speaker at a Microsoft breakfast I attended on Tuesday. An audience member
asked if the next Bill Gates could come out of India or China, particularly
given their culture of copying. 

Personally, I felt this question reflected the usual lack of comprehension for
the sheer amount of talent and skill coming out of these countries. Each year
they are the world's leading producers of Bachelor degree trained people. Steve
Balmer also pointed this out. 

But, what he went on to say was more interesting. He believes that an Indian or
Chinese person may well be the next Bill Gates, but that they will do it from
inside the US. His three reasons were:
1. IP protection
2. The legal system
3. Access to the world's largest domestic market

Unfortunately, this provides further evidence for my growing scepticism that
Australia will not produce the next Bill Gates or Google. While we have the IP
protection, legal system and talent our domestic market is just too small to
support a sizable pool of early adopting customers and rapid growth. Our
inherently conservative investment and customer market further decreases the
presence of early stage customers.

As a result, Australian companies must start exporting before they are ready.
Their products are still weak and the processes incomplete, which is brutal
when you add distance into the equation. A local customer can be courted,
worked on and built as a partnership to iron out the early adoption kinks.

While sceptical, I haven't yet descended into complete pessimism. But the odds
are certainly stacked against an Australian Bill Gates or Google.
