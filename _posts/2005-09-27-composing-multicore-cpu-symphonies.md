title: "Composing multicore CPU symphonies"
---

Borrowing from the infinitely more eloquent writing and ideas of
[Eric](http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Choir.html) and
[Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html), music provides a
richer basis for the multicore CPU metaphor I tried to [build
yesterday](/v2/blog/2005/09/rewriting-software-development.html).

Programming for single core CPUs is like composing a powerful solo
piece.

Programming for multicore CPUs is like composing for a band,
choir or symphony.
