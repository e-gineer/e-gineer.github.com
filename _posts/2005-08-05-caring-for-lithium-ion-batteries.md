title: "Caring for lithium ion batteries"

[Lithium ion batteries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery)
should be recharged early and often. Running them down to nothing actually
decreases their life. For me, this means simply putting my phone on the charger
every night.

This is in contrast to the older [NiCd batteries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-cadmium_battery), which suffered
from the [memory effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_effect).
