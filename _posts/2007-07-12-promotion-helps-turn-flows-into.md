title: Promotion helps turn flows into authorative stocks
---

Before the Web, the availability of information was tied to the ubiquity of
the promotion medium. Today, all information is equally accessible<sup>1</sup>,
but promotion can accelerate its distribution.

Before the Web,
information was strictly divided into stocks (books) and flows (newspapers
&amp; magazines). Today, through the power of search flows are immediately
converted into stock resources.<sup>2</sup>

Before the Web, promotion
could only be used to maximise exposure through flows. Today, promotion is used
to speed up information flow. Speeding up dissemination of your ideas allows
you to set the agenda, frame the context and establish yourself as an
authority. In effect, speed helps establish your flow as the stock
resource.<sup>3</sup>

When executed correctly, promotion today provides
far more potential for long term value than previous mediums ever enabled.
Establish the context and conversation and you will become established as the
authorative stock.

Footnotes:
1. All information lives on a web page, and can be seen by simple distribution of a link. In that way, my lowly blog post is equal to CNN's biggest story of the year.
2. [Background on stocks and flows](http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/000593.html).
3. Search engines are complex beasts and continually evolving, but this is roughly true of [how they work](http://www.googleguide.com/google_works.html).
