title: "Searching for the real nathan wallace"
---

A few days ago, my [personal home page](http://www.e-gineer.com/nathan/) and
[blog](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/) suddenly lost all of their Google
juice. After being the number one result on "[nathan
wallace](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=nathan+wallace)" for many
years all of a sudden I'm not even in the top 200 results.

The weird thing is that the top 10 results are still pretty much all to do with
me, they are just specific articles I wrote, people pointing to my blog or
profile pages about me on other websites.

The dropped pages are still in Google's index and can be found through very
specific searches.

The only explanations I can come up with are:
1. I'm using 301 permanent redirects from the old URLs like http://www.e-gineer.com/nathan/index.phtml to [http://www.e-gineer.com/nathan/](http://www.e-gineer.com/nathan/). This is part of changing my site to purely static content.
2. This blog is published to the e-gineer site using FTP from Blogger. You can tell since the pages contain metadata saying it is blogger generated. Perhaps the splog problem is being targetted even harder by Google.
3. I've actively started updating the e-gineer site and the pigeons really don't like the direction my content is taking...

I love Google and rely on their services for email, blogging and my daily
searching. No complaints here. But, I am searching for reasons as to why I'm
suddenly being cast off into the index wilderness.  Google, why don't you like
me anymore?

*Update (Oct 14, 2005): My [blog](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/) has jumped back up to result #3.*

*Update (Oct 15, 2005): My [blog](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/) is now #2 and the [Nathan](http://www.e-gineer.com/nathan/) page #3.*

*Update (Dec 3, 2005): I was lost, but now I'm found. Google, Yahoo and MSN all have the [Nathan](http://www.e-gineer.com/nathan/) page #1 and my [blog](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/) #2.*

*Update (Jan 2, 2006): Google has completely shunned me again.*

*Update (Feb 4, 2006): I'm back at #1 & #2 again.*
