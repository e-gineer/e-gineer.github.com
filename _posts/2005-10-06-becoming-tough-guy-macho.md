[Deal and Kennedy's cultural model](http://changingminds.org/explanations/culture/deal_kennedy_culture.htm)
groups organisations into one of four categories. I often reflect on this model
when evaluating new ideas or projects.

I like to aim for "tough guy
macho". It allows me to think big, learn fast and make [lots of non-fatal
mistakes](http://software.ericsink.com/bos/Make_More_Mistakes.html).
