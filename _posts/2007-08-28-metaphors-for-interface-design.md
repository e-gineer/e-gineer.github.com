title: Metaphors for interface design
---
	
Over the last few years, user experience has become my primary focus when
building processes and systems. But, I never truly understood the importance of
interface design until I read [this post](http://www.andyrutledge.com/elements-of-communication-part-1.php)
by Andy Rutledge.

Andy intelligently draws a metaphor where
words represent content (what you are saying) and body language represents
interface design (how you look as you say it). He also beautifully illustrates
that a huge component of all communication is non-verbal, although it is less
than the sensationalist 93% that people inaccurately extrapolate from
[Mehrabian's communication study](http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/body_language/mehrabian.htm).

What is your interface design saying?
