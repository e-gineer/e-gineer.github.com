title: "Once you enter, you are an incumbent"
---

A nice articulation from Peter Rip of why many entrepreneurs will face [the
same problems in Web 2.0](http://earlystagevc.typepad.com/earlystagevc/2005/10/the_web_20_entr.html)
that investors faced in Web 1.0:

> [T]he root causes are the same:
> 
> 1. It is very easy to make the initial commitment (founding or funding).
> 2. Underestimation of how many had the same conclusion.
> 3. Underestimation of survival requirements for the â€˜too many competitors' case.
> 
> ...
> 
> Reduced barriers to entry always look attractive to the entrants. But once you
> enter, you are an incumbent.
