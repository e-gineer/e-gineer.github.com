title: "Synop Sydney office tour"

A quick tour of the [Synop](http://www.synop.com) Sydney office in Artarmon,
where we worked from November 2000 to July 2005. The background music reflects
both our attitude and the fact that we'd have [loud singalong
tracks](http://www.mp3.com/albums/590209/summary.html) playing in the
development lab much of the time.

The "horrible smoking accountant" would sit in the office next door sucking on
cigarettes. Unfortunately, the smoke would filter over through the roof and
into the office, making the air fairly stale some days.
