[JCintra, our Intranet Wiki](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/08/our-intranet-wiki-case-study-of-wiki.htm),
has seen incredible levels of adoption and
participation, with a positive impact on the way information flows in
our organisation.

Over 18 months, JCintra amassed 23,335
content contributions from 239 (~70%) people. The number of
contributions per month continues to increase steadily.

/></a> 

But, JCintra continues to function as an incredibly easy
to use Intranet, rather than as a genuine Wiki. In fact, 85% of our
3000 pages only have one contributing author. (Interestingly,
[this behaviour occurs even at Atlassian](http://blogs.atlassian.com/news/2007/09/wikipedia_is_no.html),
who build Wiki software as their business!)

This article documents our cultural journey so
far, and outlines our ideas for driving the next phase of
change.

## Technical and Cultural Maturity

### What does success look like?

Decisions about information sharing in organisations like [Janssen-Cilag](http://www.janssen-cilag.com.au/) are
complex. Some information should be open, but isn't. Some information
needs to be closed and controlled. Some ideas should be discussed in
the open, while other ideas need to be carefully
communicated.

Success is defined by what we do, not what we
have the opportunity to do. Implementing a Wiki isn't success,
building an organisation that will take collective ownership and
collaboratively edit content is. Technology creates opportunity for
changes of behaviour and helps shift the conversation away from
excuses (it's too hard) to reasons (it's too risky).

Frankly, at Janssen-Cilag, we don't yet know exactly how we should be
communicating and collaborating. But, we do know that the steps we've
taken so far have improved communication, increased our flexibility
and given people the power to run with ideas. We want to continue
this journey, [pushing more power to the edge of the organisation](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2005/08/making-powerful-decisions-from-edge.htm).

### The Enterprise Collaboration Maturity Model

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/EnterpriseCollaborationMaturityModel.jpg"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right;
MARGIN-LEFT: 10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/EnterpriseCollaborationMaturityModel-Thumbnail.jpg"
/></a> 

All knowledge work is either individual or group based,
and it is always performed in an individual, shared or open
environment.

The [Enterprise Collaboration Maturity Model](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/EnterpriseCollaborationMaturityModel.jpg) depicts these work models, and
incorporates the cultural journey that enterprises take to reach each
stage. Currently, Janssen-Cilag provides an open Wiki (high
capability maturity) but primarily uses it as Groupware (medium usage
maturity).

To continue our journey, Janssen-Cilag needs to
become comfortable with the idea that published content is not
finalised. Specifically, we need users to:
1. Make contributions in an open space that are not policy or announcements.
2. Edit work or information that is owned collectively.

Successful Enterprise 2.0 style
collaboration requires both technical and cultural maturity. While
technology opens immediate potential, organisations must grow towards
new patterns of usage and collaboration.

## The two cultural barriers to collaboration

There are dozens
of reasons and millions of excuses as to why people won't share
knowledge; but they all fall within two areas:
1. Sharing knowledge adds more work ("I don't have time to share"); and
2. Sharing knowledge increases personal risk ("I don't want to share").

These negatives cannot be eradicated, but they can be minimised.

### Reducing additional work

Collaboration and knowledge sharing take time. The
technical process takes time, but more significantly, wording your
thoughts takes time.

Tools for collaboration must do everything
possible to reduce the friction of contributing. It needs to be so
easy to use, that you can literally laugh at anyone who tells you it
is too hard (in a nice, let me show you, kind of way). In practice
this means single sign on, one-click editing and instant
gratification on saving. Hurdles like slow technology, login screens,
workflow approvals or training kill collaboration before you even
start.

The time taken to correctly phrase thoughts and distil
ideas is unavoidable, but can be minimised by changing our
expectation of shared content away from "finished product" towards
"work in progress". Publishing information early and often (rather
than infrequently and completely) moves authorship away from essays
and succinct conclusions towards sharing of insights and decisions.
The ultimate method for sharing without increasing work is to move
the work in progress into an open environment (share everything by
default).

Policy opportunities exist to move (but not reduce)
the work of sharing knowledge. For example, information is shared
verbally on the condition that the recipient will publish it for
wider consumption. He who asks, documents. A solution like this
rewards the giver with time, builds knowledge on-demand and provides
learning reinforcement for the recipient.

### Reducing the personal risk of sharing knowledge

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/JCintraHomePage.jpg"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left;
BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/JCintraHomePage-Thumbnail.jpg"
/></a> 

Collaboration and knowledge sharing increase personal
risk by creating a published, traceable flow of inputs (My mistakes
are permanently recorded!) and making past information less valuable
than new ideas (What if they don't need me anymore?).

Risk can
be offset by increased rewards, such as recognition for contributions
or performance objectives based around knowledge sharing. In practice
however, these are hard to implement or judge.

In fact, most
people are comfortable with publishing or sharing "finished product".
At Janssen-Cilag we've seen this through high usage of news
announcements and publication of documents. Unfortunately, most
knowledge work is a constant work in progress without a clear
end-point and thus never reaches the point of being shared.

The
solution is to encourage content contributions that are finished
enough to be low-risk publishable, but are not so big as to never
reach completion. Encourage people to contribute to a flow of
insights and decisions that are made as part of larger projects.
Adding to the flow of information (I'm adding to the discussion) is
far less risky than publishing final knowledge (I own the final
decision) or changing existing content (I'm changing the company
position).

## Own the flow and the stocks will come

News announcements have been the most
successful part of JCintra. Open for publishing by anyone in the
organisation, they have replaced email for announcements ranging from
major organisational change through to baby
announcements.

Through this flow of news, JCintra has become
the trusted source for the latest information. "Did you see the
announcement on JCintra?", is not an uncommon question around the
office. As a result, users also expect JCintra to have the latest
policies and information. By owning the flow of news, we've created
the trusted source for information stocks.

There are three
critical information flows, each of which creates its own stock over
time:
1. The flow of news becomes a stock of facts and decisions.
2. The flow of projects becomes a stock of investigations and outcomes.
3. The flow of ideas becomes a stock of potential and experts.

A focus on capturing the flow has many advantages:
* The system always contains the latest information, building trust and adoption.
* The process is easy to enforce and success is readily measured (by monitoring email announcements, the only alternative).
* Work and risk is minimised for contributors.
* Through search, [archived flows become a rich and readily available stock](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/07/promotion-helps-turn-flows-into.htm).

Over time, the flow of decisions and
insights washes over the organisation, helping each person refine
their mental map and build a personal body of knowledge. When new
items fit their mental model, they can be increasingly confident and
aligned in decision making. When news doesn't fit their mental model,
they can seek clarity or raise an area of concern.

Focus on owning the flow of information, then have the patience to watch the
stocks gradually compile.

## Manifesto for Collaboration Tools

Shamelessly stealing from the [Agile Manifesto](http://www,agilemanifesto.org/), I
propose the following values for building Enterprise 2.0
collaboration systems:
* *Individuals and interactions *over processes and tools.
* *Ease of use* over comprehensive training.
* *Flexible tools* over completeness.
* *Responding to needs* over creating demand.

(That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.)

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/JCintraPeopleSearch.jpg"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: left; BORDER-LEFT:
0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/JCintraPeopleSearch-Thumbnail.jpg"
/></a> 

We are building processes and tools to help with
collaboration, but should never forget that the main thing is that
people actually work together and talk to one another. We don't need to
capture every conversation or every piece of knowledge, we just want to
strengthen weak ties.

Training in systems is important, but only
after we've done everything possible to design for zero training. In an
enterprise, your Mum really is the end user; design for her! Always
sacrifice features and power for ease of use. The minute you have to
train people you will lose them to the "more work" excuse.

It's
tempting to aim for tools that deliver exactly what people need in
different scenarios. To always take tools that one step further to
capture their exact requirements. In reality, people like to push and
abuse tools that are comfortable, flexible and part of their every day
work (e.g. email, Excel). Wiki's, blogs and search are great examples
of simple tools that can be used for a myriad of purposes without
needing a million customisations or extensions.

Finally, deliver
solutions that meet an existing need. If you build it, they won't come.
But, you can build it around where they already are.

## Next steps for Janssen-Cilag

At Janssen-Cilag, our Wiki has
settled into a steady pattern of news publication and simple intranet
editing. It is well established and respected for these tasks. Our aim
is to build on the strengths of JCintra, while expanding into new areas
of knowledge capture.

First we will make internal blogging
available to all employees. Links to new posts will be interspersed
with news on the home page, creating a flow of ideas in the trusted
location but not taking valuable attention away from the full content
news items. The people directory will also have direct links to recent
posts.

<a
href="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/Jitter.jpg"><img
style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT:
10px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"
src="http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/Jitter-Thumbnail.jpg"
/></a> 

Second, we'll add a [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) /
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) style status capability
to the people directory which has a history and can be updated via SMS.
This is a powerful micro-blogging solution for our field personnel and
will be integrated with the <a
href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator/FX101729051033.aspx">Office
Communicator</a> Note field. Recent status updates will also be
incorporated into the home page news feed, but in a very lightweight
way. (The [Jitter screenshot](http://www.e-gineer.com/v2/blog/2007/12/Jitter.jpg)
shows our early experiment in this area, which we have
decided not to launch but instead integrate into the people
directory.)

Finally, we hope to expand our internal project
management offering with something in the style of [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/),
which can create a feed of project related milestone news for the home
page.

Overall, the aim is to build on the strengths of JCintra by
adding ideas and project milestones to the flow of information that
washes past people on the Intranet home page. With time this will build
a powerful stock but, most importantly, it immediately provides ideas
and stimulation to drive interactions between
individuals.

## Conclusion

Successful
Enterprise 2.0 style collaboration requires both technical and cultural
maturity. Janssen-Cilag has adopted an open Wiki with the potential for
collective ownership, but usage remains dominated by individual
contributions to a shared space. This is reflected in the high usage of
JCintra's news column for announcements and the regular publishing of
team and policy information.

To encourage an organisational shift
along the enterprise collaboration maturity model, Enterprise 2.0
leaders should focus on capturing the flow of information. Over time,
the flow builds not only a stock of searchable knowledge but also a
reputation as the source of fresh ideas and trusted up-to-date
content.

Building on the success of our Intranet Wiki,
Janssen-Cilag plans to introduce internal blogging and personal status
updates to encourage the flow of individual insights and
decisions.

  <div class="blogCommentBody">Interestingly your SERIOUS wiki case appeared in a search for Enterprise 2.0 Open Boston that I'm attending next week. I wonder if you've submitted to Andrew McAfee's Cases 2.0 wiki so it is more readily available.  <BR/><BR/>Your comments on 'culture" resonated. My blogging colleague and I have a piece coming in Effective Executive Magazine that was inspired by Bob Buckman's March 2007 comment to the AOK Yahoo Group:<BR/><BR/>"but I never did try and manage knowledge. What I really tried to manage and nurture was a culture that would encourage and expand the flow of knowledge.".  <BR/>~ Robert H. Buckman<BR/>http://tinyurl.com/5czyo8<BR/><BR/>Fortunately we were able to interview Mr. Buckman for our article and he reiterated:<BR/><BR/>"If you look at it from the standpoint of how much effort it takes to achieve and effect knowledge sharing across an organization, you will find that the technology piece is about 5 to 10 percent of the effort, changing the way work is done is the 90 to 95 percent of the effort. You can define the effort as time or as money, it still comes out about the same"   ~ Robert H. Buckman<BR/><BR/>Best with all your endeavours.<BR/><BR/>~ Jenny Ambrozek</div>
