title: "Personal IT: Password management"

Managing the myriad of passwords for systems is a huge headache for everyone.
Personally I use the [KeePass](http://keepass.sourceforge.net/) software to
keep a complete list of all passwords.

It's good to get in the habit of making passwords around 8 letters long that
use a combination of lower case, upper case and numerics. This seems to be the
sweet spot for getting through the various "security enforcing" password
systems. Of course, with each one subtlely different it's a nightmare trying to
do anything consistent. I like to use simple word / number combinations (e.g.
song title & length in secs) or words with some letters substituted for
numbers (e.g. t00thbru5h).

I have employed a system for many years of having a secret number which is
combined with a sensible keyword on each site (e.g. blogger5147, gmail5147,
etc). Unfortunately this means that should the number become compromised you
have to change all your passwords. Some protection to this can be offered by
having different numbers for different levels of security, but the site owners
may still store the raw password and be able to compromise you in other places.

At Synop, we've employed both the above systems to good effect even as the
company and number of passwords quickly grew.
