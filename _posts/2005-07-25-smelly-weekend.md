The hot water system in our apartment building broke, leaking water down
through the lift shaft. With no shower and extra sweat created coming up the
stairs, this was a double blow.

I love the unlimited hot water in our apartment block and was amazed at how
small the broken tank actually was (yes - it's in the crane shown in the
video).
