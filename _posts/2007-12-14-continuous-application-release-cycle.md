title: Continuous Application Release Cycle

## Introduction

The Continuous Application Release Cycle
is a simple process for providing predictable, stable releases in a rapid and
sustainable way. It is not a detailed methodology for release planning,
development or testing.

Agile methods, open source development and online
applications (often in perpetual beta) have established the power of fast
iterations and release of minor versions. Release early, release often! I've
successfully used the Continuous Application Release Cycle with high velocity
applications ranging from publically downloadable software (Sauce Reader)
through to internal enterprise web applications.

## The Continuous Application Release Cycle

Adopting this cycle brings certainty and
momentum to end users while ensuring continuous improvement and low risk
release management for developers. Developers move seamlessly from one version
to the next, with only a small cross-over for bug fixing during the Beta
period.

*Release planning* is a high level determination of the features and bug fixes
that will be incorporated into the release.

*Feature development &amp; Bug fixing* is the rapid development of wide-spread
code changes to implement the planned features.

*Design review &amp; Feature freeze* is a formal examination of the design and
implementation of features for this release. Ensure they are neatly integrated
into the application and do not compromise its integrity or simplicity. Build a
final design / development plan to finish integration of the features, or delay
their release until a future version.

*Final development, Help &amp; training and Bug fixing* is a finalisation
phase, with consolidation and review of the code base. New capabilities may be
added to finalise features, but major surgery should be avoided. Help and
training materials for new features are constructed in parallel.

*Beta launch* puts the application through standard test suites and launches to
the Beta user group.

*Beta testing &amp; Bug fixing* has Beta users installing, trying and testing
new application features. Appropriate bugs may be fixed with careful control
and testing.

*Launch* puts the application through standard test suites and launches to all
users on production.

*Production* is wide-spread use of this application version. Bugs and feedback
are collected for integration into the next version.

## The CARC in practice

The length of the
cycle varies depending on the type of application, but I've found that monthly
releases work well in practice. The development phase lasts about 4 weeks, with
1 week of Beta testing before launch. Each version is in production for about 4
weeks. 

The fast development cycle means each release has fewer changes,
facilitating a short testing cycle and removing the heavy crunch that typically
accompanies software releases. For developers, the key delivery date is the
release to Beta testing. With experience, the release to production becomes
increasingly routine.

Regular, planned releases keeps developers close to
customer needs and allows rapid response to application problems or competitive
features. End users enjoy a sense of momentum from the application, and become
increasingly engaged as their suggestions, feedback and problems are quickly
addressed.
