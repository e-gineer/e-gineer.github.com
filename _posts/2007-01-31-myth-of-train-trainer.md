title: The myth of train the trainer
---

In the majority of cases, train the trainer is doomed to failure for 3
reasons:
1. Training the wrong people
2. Pushing work downwards
3. Playing Chinese whispers

Online training and
video is the only solution that provides on-demand availability, consistency of
quality and clarity of message all with a relatively low time
investment.

## Training the wrong people

By definition, train the trainer does not include training the average user. So,
two alternatives remain, train the superuser or train the non-user (e.g. team
manager). Unfortunately, both make lousy trainers. 

Superusers are very knowledgeable about the system, but overwhelm
average users with their skill, jargon and speed. The result is an impression
that the system is best left to the experts, one of whom happens to be readily
accessible and now assumed available for 24x7 support. (The same problem faced
by computer nerds when helping their family setup a PC.) 

Non-users don't
have the ongoing interaction with the system to keep their skills fresh, or
even the basic system knowledge needed to conduct training. The result is
shallow training sessions with an impression that the system must be difficult
to understand if even the trainer can't use it properly.

## Pushing work downwards

Train the trainer is a beautiful trick that
allows project owners to tick the box on training while handing over ongoing
responsibility and ownership for use of the system. Arriving with hopes of a
nice buffet lunch, the new "trainers" leave with a few PowerPoint slides and a
major new unexpected component to their job.

Project owners are given
time and resources to raise the bar and change behaviour through the
implementation. If they can't find time to prioritise training, there is no way
that users or managers swamped in their day to day tasks can do so. The result
is a gap, which no one owns and everyone will eventually refer to knowingly as
"the training issue".

It's proven again, you can't get something for nothing. 

## Chinese Whispers

Training is important
in terms of showing people how to use the system. But, it's vital in terms of
convincing people that the system is useful and helpful. Teaching someone a
skill is not the same as motivating them to use it. 

Unfortunately it's
this motivation and drive that is most quickly lost and distorted through the
train the trainer chain. Each generation of trainer interprets the usefulness
of the system and the important parts of the system differently, adding their
own spin.

Exacerbating this loss of knowledge through imperfect copying
is the natural inclination in a casual training session to skim through the
material, downplay it's importance and just skip the parts we don't understand
ourselves with an embarrassed laugh.

Train the trainer is like being in
high school and asking your friend to talk to the cute girl across the room.
They mean well, but feel silly doing the task, are vague in their message and
don't share your commitment to the
outcome.

## Alternatives to train the trainer

Typical turnover for a business is 20-25%, so new people are
starting continuously and every single one requires training in the system. The
need for training is relentless and always urgent. 

In my experience,
on-demand training packages (e.g. online, video) is the only viable solution
giving the required flexibility and control over message while keeping
resourcing to a minimum. These don't need to be highly professional or
polished, but do need to be reasonably easy to update and maintain.


## Making train the trainer work 

Despite the common
problems above, train the trainer can work when: 
1. Trainers are actually trained in how to lead the training (not just taken through the training themselves). Materials should be prepared and core messages clarified for consistent and continuous delivery to new recruits. Make it simple and time efficient to conduct training.
2. Trainers are chosen who have some interest in providing training. Whether this interest is intrinsic (I love to share knowledge) or extrinsic (increased chance of bonus) it must keep the motivation level high to conduct quality training with the core messages intact.
