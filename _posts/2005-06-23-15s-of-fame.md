title: "15s of fame"
---

Inspired by [Richard](http://www.zipworld.com.au/~kashum/blog/), I've decided
to try my hand at [videoblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog). I can't
be bothered doing huge editing and only have an [old digital
camera](http://www.steves-digicams.com/p1.html) for shooting videos, so they
will be 15 seconds or less, single scene and largely unedited. Remember, one of
the great things about short films is that even if it is crap, you know it will
be over quickly.
