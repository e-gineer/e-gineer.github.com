title: "Cleaning up after a golden shower"

Australia's [golden shower](http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/)
[fetish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_shower) has finally been sated for
another four years, but the mess will last at least a week as we grapple with
the [one-off changes to daylight
savings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_time_zones).

While the support response from vendors like Microsoft has [been
minimal](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912475/), eBay gave up completely and
simply decided to [ignore the
change](http://www2.ebay.com/aw/au/200603241810322.html).

I was
strongly tempted by the eBay approach, but it seemed a bit hardcore to create
my own [official
time](http://cgi1.ebay.com.au/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?TimeShow&ssPageName=f:f:AU&amp;hc=1&hm=um.s5ddl7437).
Instead, I'm taking the half-assed Microsoft approach and apologising in
advance for being -1 to +1 hours incorrect with any meeting time this week.
(Between work computers, home computers, EPG's and Windows Mobile I've got no
idea what time it is. Confusing things further I spent the weekend in
Queensland where daylight savings is not observed at all.)

Inconvenient at first, the stupidity of this one-off change was only truly
evident as we realised that only the final day of the Commonwealth Games
calendar would have been affected. Even if athlete's or spectators had
forgotten to change their clock they would have been an hour early!
