title: "The world isn't flat: Use enterprise context to enhance, not control"
---

Enterprises are rich in both context and control, while new social media sites
start completely flat and without either. By embracing and extending our
strengths, enterprises can take a shorter journey to successful and mature
social media than the consumer models that inspire us.

## Context and control

Most enterprise applications are built around two
things:
* Context - Who are you? What is your job? What are you trying to do?
* Control - What are you allowed to do? What do we want you to focus on?

Public social applications start with neither, but work
hard to build both over time:
* Context - Who are you? Who do you know? What do you like to do?
* Control - We prefer our members to participate and communicate in this manner.

## Revolution and Enterprise 2.0

Practicioners attracted to Enterprise 2.0 typically start through a desire for
revolution. We want to break out of the context and control forced on us by
existing applications and cultural norms. We want new models to emerge, new
opportunities to connect with others, new methods of working.

The best examples of these models are available in the consumer
space, so our natural tendency is to recreate those tools inside the firewall.
This also sits well with our desire for new models and new power. But, it is in
direct conflict with the existing norms, powerbase and way of working.

We need to heed [lessons on change from Machiavelli](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/machiavelli-on-change-and-innovation/):

> And let it be noted that there is no more delicate matter to take in hand, nor
> more dangerous to conduct, nor more doubtful in its success, than to set up as
> a leader in the introduction of changes.  For he who innovates will have for
> his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things, and
> only the lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new.
> This lukewarm temper arises partly from the fear of adversaries who have the
> laws on their side and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who will never
> admit the merit of anything new, until they have seen it proved by the event.

We need to embrace and extend.

## Embrace and extend

Revolution towards a consumer equivalent involves the complete destruction or
ignorance of existing context and control the organisation has created. This is
a huge leap of faith and not one taken easily by any established organisation.

It's also pointless. Mature social media requires high levels of context (more
than enterprises have already) and at least some level of control / agreed
behaviour.

A better approach is to embrace the existing context in your organisation. Seed
your tools with information that we know to be relevant and expected. For
example, when building an internal Twitter, automatically have everyone
following their bosses, peers and/or direct reports. When implementing a wiki,
setup areas for each existing part of the business. Don't waste people's time
and energy requiring the recreation of structures that we already know, use and
respect.

Don't give up all aspects of control either. Some groups should have closed
membership. Some areas should be locked for editing.  That's OK, the world
isn't flat.

But, extend both of the models above.  Allow new context to develop without
intervention. Remove controls that stop the development of context. Expect new
controls and conventions to form within this community.

## Conclusion

The context and control inside organisations is closer to the norms of mature
social media applications than it is to new tools. By embracing the strengths
of enterprise structures and extending by allowing users to create new context
in emergent areas practicioners can drastically reduce the barriers to approval
and adoption.

Successful Enterprise 2.0 uses context to seed flat tools, not to control them.
Successful Enterprise 2.0 accepts controls on existing areas, but frees the
organisation to create new areas, context and information.  Successful
Enterprise 2.0 knows that the world isn't flat.

    <div class="blogCommentBody">Well written article, thanks for the insight Nathan.  I can see how the synthesis of the enterprise and application context works as a catalyst allowing new synergies to develop and increase adoption.  Did Machiavelli want to heed people to take baby steps and changes like embrace and extend? Does that mean there is no way to think about change more to set it up for success? Does this mean no matter how it goes about it, an enterprise won&#39;t succeed in mastering a new &#39;unmature&#39; social media application as it still looking for its own context?</div>

    <div class="blogCommentBody">Great article. We need more analysis on enterprise 2.0 technologies, and how they affect traditional management approches and theories. As someone with a management background, and working in the enterprise 2.0 industry, i can certainly relate to the subject!</div>
