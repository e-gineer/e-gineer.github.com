title: "Rich vs King"

It's relatively well known that founder CEO's will probably be replaced, but
[this HBS article](http://hbsworkingknowledge.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=4948&amp;t=entrepreneurship)
covers the issue well:

For me, the main factor would be the skills of the replacement. I'd want what's
best for the company. Financials are important, but the main driver for me
would be to see my baby fulfill its potential.

Are you ready to be replaced? Can you pass the "Rich vs King" test?
