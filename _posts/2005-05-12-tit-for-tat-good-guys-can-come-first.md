title: "Tit for tat: Good guys can come first"
---

During a negotiation theory course for my MBA, I recently learnt about the [tit
for tat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_Tat) solution to the [prisoner's
 dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner).

While growing up, I would always prefer to avoid conflict and retaliation.
Internally, I justified this to myself as taking the high ground.
Unfortunately, to the observer, I was just getting trampled on.

Unhappy with this, I learned how to deal with conflict and no longer accept
being trampled.

Tit for tat provides a balanced approach that is optimistic, proactive and
forgiving without being weak in its responses. It is proven, logical and sound
as a strategy. Most of all, it's the type of person I try to be.
