title: "Opportunity or overwhelming odds?"
---

Last week was my last official week of [Synop](http://www.synop.com)
employment. After 7 years of blood, sweat and tears it's a significant
milestone for me personally. As part of the windup, we've had a set of farewell
lunches and parties that were helpful for everyone else but for some reason had
never given me a personal sense of closure.

Then, last Thursday,
Peter was delayed in Sydney while flying out to
[Bhutan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan). Turns out that an impromptu
afternoon in the pub together both reminiscing and contemplating the future was
exactly what I needed.

As a mental state of mind, shutting down
Synop has been weird. We had to actively avoid opportunities and ignore the
internal cries to continue doing everything possible to survive. Every past
decision is called into question and mumurings of what if are mixed with
constant self-reassurance that this was the right decision.

Gradually, I'm getting excited about new ideas again. My creative, ambitious
side is waking up and things are starting to look like opportunities rather
than overwhelming odds.
