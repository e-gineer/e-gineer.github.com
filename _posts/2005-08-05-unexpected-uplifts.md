Yesterday was my 30th birthday. Having embraced a mini-crisis a few
months back, I was well prepared for the big day and things were drifting along
in a fairly normal way.

But it turns out that Bianca had arranged a
surprise dinner for me with my parents and close friends. Talk about
transforming my birthday into a memorable event! I was shocked, touched and
amazed at their ability to lie through my normally fairly inquisitive
questions.

The night took another massive lift when I received the
<a

Xda II mini PDA phone</a> that I've been coveting for a couple of months. I
have a habit of wanting the latest, most expensive gadgetry but permanently
delaying the high price purchase decision. It's for this reason that I've been
living off hand-me-down mobile phones since 2001 and still don't own a DVD
player (although I'm currently building a HTPC). I think the joy for me of
owning a new gadget was clear to everyone. It's a truly beautiful device that
will take me months of tinkering to optimise.

This dinner was the
second unexpected uplift for me in the last week. After speaking at [Open
Publish](http://www.openpublish.com.au/) last Thursday, I got a call from
[Peter](http://cs.anu.edu.au/~Peter.Bailey/) who was stuck in Sydney waiting
for a delayed flight. After an afternoon at the pub I had a strong sense of
closure on Synop, which I'd been unable to achieve through the series of
farewells and goodbyes we'd had for other staff. There was something poetic
about Synop finishing the way it's current (and longest) phase had started,
with Peter and I dreaming up ideas over beers...
