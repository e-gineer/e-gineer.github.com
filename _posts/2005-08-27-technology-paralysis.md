title: "Technology paralysis"
---

I first craved a DVD player in 1999 after my flatmate moved out with his. From
memory, back then a decent one was $1,200AU. This seemed just a bit too
expensive, so I waited and made do with videos and a new flatmate's good Sony
68cm TV.

Then, in late 2002 the flatmate &amp; TV moved out again. Bianca and I just
ended up using her little old 34cm TV with videos.

By early 2004 it was getting harder to hire videos so we decided to spend $60
on a cheap DVD player. Unfortunately her TV was so old that it didn't support
the input cables and it would cost another $75 in adapters to make it work
(since [Macrovision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrovision) prevented us
routing the signal through the video).

Of course, at this point a new TV was justified, but we just couldn't help
wanting a flat panel, which were way too expensive. So, just like the DVD
player decision above, we waited.

Suddenly it's 2005, and I can't believe that we still don't have a DVD player!

This was a classic case of technology paralysis. I decided the only cure was to
jump the DVD cycle completely and starting building a
[HTPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTPC).

I've actually got it running though my video because it...ahem...doesn't do all that macrovision rubbish (and it's also multi region).</div>

						<div class="blogCommentBody">Interesting ... it was in trying to buy a cheap one from Dick Smith that I learnt about all the Macrovision problems (from their staff). Might have done better to try it anyway!</div>
