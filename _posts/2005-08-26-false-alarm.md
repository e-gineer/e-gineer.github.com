title: "False alarm"
---

It was incredibly eerie with our massive apartment fire alarm ringing out
through the darkness of West Chatswood. As is typical of these "emergency"
situations, after I was unable to get back to sleep through the noise I finally
went out to investigate.

This video reflects my sleepy state during filming at 1:30am. I knew it was
dark but thought you'd at least be able to see reflections of the flashing fire
engine lights.
