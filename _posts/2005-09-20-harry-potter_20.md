title: "Harry Potter"

While stuck in bed over the last couple of weeks, I've re-read all the Harry
Potter books. They really are engaging and a delight to read. I'm amazed at the
depth and consistency of the earlier books, it's clear that the entire series
was envisaged from the start.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
(#4) remains my favourite as it has the joy and innocence of the earlier books
along with some of the darkness prevalent in the later books.
