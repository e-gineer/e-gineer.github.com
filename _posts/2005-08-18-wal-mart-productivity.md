title: "Wal-Mart & productivity"

A [fascinating article about
Wal-Mart](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/walmart.html) from
FastCompany:

> There is no question that Wal-Mart's relentless drive to squeeze out costs has
> benefited consumers. The giant retailer is at least partly responsible for the
> low rate of U.S. inflation, and a McKinsey &amp; Co. study concluded that
> *about 12% of the economy's productivity gains in the second half of the 1990s
> could be traced to Wal-Mart alone*.
