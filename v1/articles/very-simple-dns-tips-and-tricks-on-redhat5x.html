<h2>Introduction</h2>

When my first web site went live I was so excited that I checked the statistics continually.  I couldn't even wait for the compiled stats from <a href="http://www.wusage.com">wusage</a>.  I was checking the raw log files.

<p>

Of course, since there were almost no visitors my log file looked like this:
<ul>
<pre>
    /wusage/access-log
    /wusage/access-log
    /wusage/access-log
    /index.html
    /logox4.gif
    /wusage/access-log
    /wusage/access-log
    /wusage/access-log
</pre>
</ul>

<p>

While trying to <strong>track down the origins of the IP addresses</strong> that were appearing in my log file (before DNS resolution was turned on) I discovered the tools in this document.  Some of them I used to check progress as the synop.com domain was changing between hosting companies.

<p>

<h2>Calculating the Hostname from the IP Address</h2>

To work out the hostname associated with an IP address use the ipcalc function.
<ul>
<pre>
    <strong>ipcalc --hostname 216.71.34.45</strong>
    HOSTNAME=synop.com
</pre>
</ul>

<p>

<h2>Getting Information about a Domain from Name Servers</h2>

The name servers on the internet cache information about domain names.  This cache is updated periodically from the root DNS servers which are currently controlled by internic.  If you make a change to your domain, such as changing hosting companies, then the name servers for the domain will usually change.  This change takes time (approx 1-2 days) to filter to all computers on the internet.

<p>

To get the information about a domain from your default name server use:
<ul>
<pre>
    <strong>dnsquery synop.com</strong>
</pre>
<pre>
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 6793
;; flags: qr rd ra; Ques: 1, Ans: 3, Auth: 2, Addit: 2
;; QUESTIONS:
;;	synop.com, type = ANY, class = IN

;; ANSWERS:
synop.com.	4228	IN	NS	ns.propagation.net.
synop.com.	4228	IN	NS	ns2.propagation.net.
synop.com.	3613	IN	A	216.71.34.45

;; AUTHORITY RECORDS:
synop.com.	4228	IN	NS	ns.propagation.net.
synop.com.	4228	IN	NS	ns2.propagation.net.

;; ADDITIONAL RECORDS:
ns.propagation.net.	171941	IN	A	216.71.32.31
ns2.propagation.net.	171941	IN	A	216.71.94.4
</pre>
</ul>

<p>

You can also ask other name servers on the internet for their records for a domain:
<ul>
<pre>
    <strong>dnsquery -n ns.internic.net synop.com</strong>
</pre>
<pre>
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 44074
;; flags: qr rd; Ques: 1, Ans: 2, Auth: 2, Addit: 2
;; QUESTIONS:
;;	synop.com, type = ANY, class = IN

;; ANSWERS:
synop.com.	172800	IN	NS	NS.CIHOST.COM.
synop.com.	172800	IN	NS	NS2.CIHOST.COM.

;; AUTHORITY RECORDS:
synop.com.	172800	IN	NS	NS.CIHOST.COM.
synop.com.	172800	IN	NS	NS2.CIHOST.COM.

;; ADDITIONAL RECORDS:
NS.CIHOST.COM.	172800	IN	A	216.71.93.147
NS2.CIHOST.COM.	172800	IN	A	216.71.94.5
</pre>
</ul>
