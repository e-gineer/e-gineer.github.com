One of the things that I love about the Internet is that a cook as terrible and inexperienced as me can publish a list of recipes. I wrote this page so that I would stop constantly ringing people for the recipes each month when I decide to cook.

<p>

This is just a collection of random recipes that I use.  I mix and match depending on which three items I have in my fridge on the day.
