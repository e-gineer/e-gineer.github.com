<h1>Books</h1>

<h2>background</h2>

<ul>

I've always enjoyed reading, but usually struggled to keep a flow on from book to book.  Since about August 2000 though I've been reading quite regularly.  I didn't realize quite how much I'd come to depend on it until a couple of weeks ago when I ran out of books and suddenly I was up until all hours of the night watching Letterman and various late night crap.

<p>

Below are some thoughts on the books I've been reading since about the start of 2001, and a place for me to remember the books I'm planning to read.

</ul>

<h2>recent</h2>

<ul>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345404793">Protect and Defend</a>, Richard North Patterson&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>December 2001</i><br>
The first time I've even come close to questioning my pro-choice opinion on abortion.  An
interesting and challenging read that I couldn't put down.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380703122">Whirlwind</a>, James Clavell&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>December 2001</i><br>
Particularly interesting reading about an Islamic revolution in the context of things currently unfolding
in Afganistan.  Hearing about the chaos of change and the systems of goverment was interesting, the
insight into what ordinary people go through fascinating, and realizing why the US government might give
guns to Iran in a situation like that was helpful.
<p>

</ul>

<p>

<h2>statistics</h2>

<b>41</b> books in 2001 at a rate of 3.42 per month (12 months).

<h2>thoughts</h2>

<ul>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446603589">Absolute Power</a>, David Baldacci&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>August 2001</i><br>
Another great plot and story from this writer.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345402871">Airframe</a>, Michael Crichton&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>July 2001</i><br>
Captivating from the first page and lots to learn.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345401018">Apaches</a>, Lorenzo Carcaterra&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dec 2000</i><br>
Sleepers was great but I had to wade through this disjointed, unlikable novel.  I only finished it because I had nothing better to read.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553569570">The Apocalypse Watch</a>, Robert Ludlum&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Feb 2001</i><br>
I waded through the first 200 pages and then gave up.  I don't like to give up on a book, but when it
reaches a point where I'd rather watch late night TV than read it is time to move on.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786808012">Artemis Fowl</a>, Eoin Colfer&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>August 2001</i><br>
Brings fairies to life, but you might not like them...
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061099341">As The Crow Flies</a>, Jeffrey Archer&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>November 2001</i><br>
Another great book from Archer that I devoured on Guatemalan "chicken buses".
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/014028009X">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>, Helen Fielding&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>June 2001</i><br>
Light with a few things that made me laugh out loud.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446677477">The Cashflow Quadrant</a>, Robert Kiyosaki&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>August 2001</i><br>
Among other things, it gave me great insight into the difference between being self-employed and owning a business.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345378490">Congo</a>, Michael Chrichton&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>November 2001</i><br>
Absorbing and fascinating.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671004107">Contact</a>, Carl Sagan&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jan 2001</i><br>
Great science fiction, but I also loved the tie in with religious issues.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345331354">Cosmos</a>, Carl Sagan&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jan 2001</i><br>
Fascinating, the one concept that truly blew my mind is the vastness of time on a cosmic scale.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553268465">The Dogs of War</a>, Frederick Forsyth&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>September 2001</i><br>
I don't think I've ever read a book by Frederick Forsyth that I didn't love.  The detail is incredible and fascinating.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887307280">The E-Myth Revisited</a>, Michael Gerber&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>September 2001</i><br>
I read this book soon after starting my business 3 years ago.  I wish that I'd understood it then.  Reading it again now I can see so many of our growth problems outlined perfectly.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201709376">Extreme Programming in Practice</a>, James W Newkirk, Robert C Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>July 2001</i><br>
They make some interesting observations but I am not sure that it warrants a full book.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1564145565">Good Service Is Good Business: 7 Simple Strategies for Success</a>, Catherine DeVyre&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jan 2001</i><br>
Maybe I just wasn't ready to learn about customer service yet.  Most of the ideas in this book seem
to be more relevant to larger corporations or consumer oriented companies.  Using "case studies"
solicited and written by organizations themselves seems a bit lazy to me.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/059035342X">Harry Potter and the Sourcerer's Stone</a>, J. K. Rowling&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Apr 2001</i><br>
When I see kids who never read books engrossed in a huge novel I had to try it.  Great characters and
fantastic ideas.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439064864">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a>, J. K. Rowling&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Apr 2001</i><br>
I love these books...  5 minutes after finishing this I went out to buy the 3rd one.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439136350">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>, J. K. Rowling&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May 2001</i><br>
They just keep getting better...
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439139597">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>, J. K. Rowling&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May 2001</i><br>
Now I just have to wait for the 5th one along with everyone else.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786864370">How to Become CEO</a>, Jeffrey J Fox&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>June 2001</i><br>
As with all books like this you have to take it with a grain of salt.  I believe that everyone
has their own work and leadership style.  By presenting some rules / formulae this book might
help you to review your own style.
<p>

How to Get New Business in 90 Days and Keep it Forever, Wendy Evans&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jan 2001</i><br>
Lots of great marketing ideas.  Made a tech guy like me feel that sales / marketing are not beyond
my comprehension.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1875889329">How to Sell Stacks and Stacks of Anything</a>, Doug Malouf&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>June 2001</i><br>
I like the way this book spends some time talking about personal motivation.  This is
definitely one of the big challenges for sales and marketing people IMO.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446604801">Jack and Jill</a>, James Patterson&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May 2001</i><br>
Good story, but a very weird writing style.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061007129">Kane and Abel</a>, Jeffrey Archer&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>August 2001</i><br>
So good that I read this 500+ page book in less than 48 hours.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399501487">Lord of the Flies</a>, William Golding&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Feb 2001</i><br>
I'm glad I could skim it since I wasn't reading it as a school text.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679781587">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>, Arthur S Golden&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>June 2001</i><br>
Very interesting, believable and easy to read.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857821351">The Nemesis File</a>, Paul Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>July 2001</i><br>
Horrible. You know it is true but don't want to believe it.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1551802309">No B.S. Sales Success</a>, Dan Kennedy&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>June 2001</i><br>
A good guide to sales as opposed to marketing.  I keep referring back to this book
for ideas and approaches.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553271989">The Odessa File</a>, Frederick Forsyth&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jan 2001</i><br>
I had no idea that one of the key ideas behind the holocaust was to make it a profitable business.  This book also helped me
to better understand the whole concept of collective guilt associated with this terrible part of human history.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034543014X">The Princess Bride</a>, William Goldman&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mar 2001</i><br>
I loved the movie and the book was just even more clever.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446677450">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a>, Robert Kiyosaki&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>August 2001</i><br>
Like most books of this type, it has one key idea.  Build wealth through investments that have positive cashflow.  Great if you take the time to reflect on that key idea.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312957572">The Seventh Scroll</a>, Wilbur Smith&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Apr 2001</i><br>
The characters are a little simple at times but I think I've found another author to explore.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061013706">Shall We Tell the President?</a>, Jeffrey Archer&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>August 2001</i><br>
Enjoyable from the first moment.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0515131210">Shattered</a>, Dick Francis&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>November 2001</i><br>
I own nearly all the Dick Francis books and love them.  But this one was slow to start, felt awkward and really wasn't anywhere near as good as the others.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446607711">The Simple Truth</a>, David Baldacci&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>June 2001</i><br>
I love books like this, learn lots while enjoying the story.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671676172">Solo</a>, Jack Higgins&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Apr 2001</i><br>
Readable, but lucky it was short.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440234743">The Testament</a>, John Grisham&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Apr 2001</i><br>
Great first chapter that carries you through an otherwise fairly ordinary book.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345417623">Timeline</a>, Michael Crichton&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>July 2001</i><br>
The modern day bits were interesting, the parts from the past were not.  I felt there were holes in his plot this time.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399144463">Who Moved My Cheese?</a>, Spencer Johnson&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Feb 2001</i><br>
Focus on the story and draw your own conclusions.  The introduction and discussion seem
like a bit of a sales pitch for the book itself.
<p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Hewitt-Gleeson%2C%20Michael%20A.">The X10 Memplex</a>, Michael Hewitt-Gleeson&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jan 2001</i><br>
I'm not sure about the times everything by 10 philosophy spouted in this book.  But I did pick up on another
key idea, viewing sales as a dialogue with potential customers rather than as doing everything possible to
"close the sale".
