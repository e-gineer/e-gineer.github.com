title: Installing MySQL 3.x.x from Source on Linux
---

<em>by <a href="../../nathan/">Nathan Wallace</a></em> (Oct 22, 1999)

<p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

These instructions describe the installation of <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> from source.  They should work for most linux distributions.

<p>

The process is completely identical to <a href="install-mysql3xx-on-linux.htm">installing from binaries</a> except for the Installing section.  In fact, to prevent duplication these instructions point you to the post install part of the binary installation.

<p>

<h2>Before We Begin</h2>

<ol>

<li>These instructions assume that you are working as root.
<pre>
    su root
</pre>

</ol>

<p>

<h2>Getting MySQL</h2>

<ol>

<li>You can determine the latest stable version of MySQL at the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/download.html">downloads page</a>.  For this installation I'm using <a href="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/MySQL-3.22/mysql-3.22.27.tar.gz">MySQL 3.22.27</a>.

<p>

<li>Download the binary distribution for PC Linux.  Save it into your /usr/local/downloads directory.  If you haven't already created a downloads directory you can do so now with:
<pre>
    mkdir /usr/local/downloads
</pre>
Then we can download the distribution:
<pre>
    cd /usr/local/downloads
    ftp ftp.mysql.com <em>(user: anonymous password: email address)</em>
    cd MySQL-3.23
    bin
    get mysql-3.23.28-gamma.tar.gz
    bye
</pre>

</ol>

<p>

<h2>Installing MySQL</h2>

<ol>

<li>Unpack the MySQL download into the source directory on your machine (NB: that's a capital C):
<pre>
    tar xzf mysql-3.23.28-gamma.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src
</pre>

<p>

<li>Configure the installation.
<pre>
    cd /usr/local/src/mysql-3.23.28-gamma
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
</pre>

<p>

<li>Make and install the binaries.  These steps will take a long time:
<pre>
    make
    make install
</pre>

</ol>

<p>

<h2>Post Install Instructions</h2>

The post install process on most systems is identical to that for the <a href="install-mysql3xx-on-linux.htm">MySQL installation from binaries</a>.  You still need to configure your installation, setup users, and so on, so start at the <a href="install-mysql3xx-on-linux.htm#configuring">Configuring MySQL section</a>.

<p>

There might be some small differences since some scripts are still in the source directory structure, not the installed one.  For example, mysql_install_db is located in the scripts directory in the /usr/local/src structure.  You should be able to find most things pretty easily.
