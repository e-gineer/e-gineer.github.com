<h1>Setting up an IBM Thinkpad X22</h1>

<em>by <a href="../../nathan/">Nathan Wallace</a></em> (Oct 31, 2001)

<p>
<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

With a massive deadline to complete before leaving the country for a couple of months I decided this
was the best time to buy a new laptop to help me on my travels.  My last machine was a Mitac derivative
and while still grunty a year after I bought it (Oct 2000) with 850MHz 256MB RAM, DVD etc it is just
to clunky for my liking.

<p>

The X22 is fantastic.  Light, sturdy.  I'm in love with it already.  Of course, love only comes after
spending massive amounts of time together and fighting through horrible installation problems.

<p>

I decided to buy the machine without a docking station etc since I'd really only need a CD-ROM for
installations anyway.  So this is an attempted install with no CD-ROM or floppy drive.

<p>

I've explained my entire machine setup below.  A new X22 running Windows XP with Red Hat Linux 7.2.  At
the time of writing you just can't get much more cutting edge than that!

<p>

Be warned that this document is a little all over the place.  I wanted to try and capture all the
things I'd learned through the installation process to help others in a similar situation.  The info
on the net about this stuff currently seems quite disjointed.

<p>

Note that there are a lot of similarities between this notebook and the IBM Thinkpad T23.  Once I
worked that out I got a lot of useful info by doing web searches on the T23.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Delivered Installation</h2>

The delivered machine has a hidden partition where Windows 2000 sits.  This means that you can restore
your machine completely at any point by pressing F11 during the boot sequence.  This takes about 1GB of
your precious disk space.  It turns out that IBM seem to format the hard disk in a really weird manner
that brings all sorts of problems with Linux partitioning programs.  I don't totally understand it, but
they seem to have setup the partition with 240 heads per cylinder rather than the recommended 255. Even
Partition Magic doesn't like this and reported my entire hard disk as a bad partition at one low point.

<p>

The 2000 installation from IBM runs very cleanly.  First you note that it uses Win98 as the platform to
start the installation.  Interesting (and an omen).

<p>

All the network drivers etc work beautifully out of the box, as they should.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Trying to Install Linux from Windows 2000 with No Floppy and No CD-ROM</h2>

Beginning the Linux installation with no floppy or CD-ROM is interesting.  It turns out that there is
a program autoboot.bat in the dosutils directory of your Red Hat CD.  This is able to boot into Linux
directly from Windows 98.  It does not work from Windows 2000.  There is no DOS mode in Windows 2000,
even if you boot into command prompt only safe mode.

<p>

So, you can't boot linux from the machine to start the install.  If you are a true maniac you might
consider booting into the IBM service program and trying to get to a dos prompt.  I've seen this, but
it might have been when I managed to crash the service auto install at some point.

<p>

The only solution I could find to this problem was to remove the hard drive from the machine and do
the installation elsewhere.  This was suggested by someone with a Vaio.  This is actually surprisingly
simple to do. There are instructions for removing the hard disk in the manual, basically undo one screw
and pull it out.

<p>

I plugged the hard disk into my old Mitac above for installation.  Alternatively you can buy a 44 pin
to 40 pin adaptor to put the notebook hard disk into your desktop machine.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Partition your Drive First</h2>

With hindsight, this is the time to partition your whole hard drive.  Use Partition Magic from inside
Windows 2000, the command line Partition Magic boot disks don't seem to like the hard drive layout either.  None of the
other tools seemed to support all the functionality we need.  By partitioning the drive now we can 
completely avoid problems with linux partitioning tools like disk druid blowing up during the installation
because of the weird IBM service partion which makes them all think the disk is inconsistent.

<p>

You need to create a number of partitions:
<ul>
<li>Windows 98 FAT 32 partition, say 1GB
<li>Windows XP FAT 32 partition, say 6GB (use FAT 32 since it plays nicely with linux etc)
<li>Linux EXT2 partition, say 6GB (use EXT2 since Partition Magic etc support it better)
<li>Linux Swap partition, say 256MB
<li>Leave the IBM Service partition alone!
</ul>

<p>

If you don't want to run XP you can stick with 2000 by just resizing that partition instead.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Back to Good Old Windows 98</h2>

Since we want to actually do the linux installation on the IBM notebook your aim here is to set things
up to make that possible.  I'd love to know if there is a way to write the files from a simple linux
floppy boot disk to a bootable hard drive partition.  This would seem like an obvious capability but
I couldn't find anything describing the process.  Then we could just boot the installation floppy image
from the hard drive and start the install.

<p>

In the end, the only process I could think of was to install Windows 98 first.  I struggled with this,
but all of the Linux installation tools seem to be written for use with DOS versions.  After we have
a working Windows 98 partition everything will be sweet, we can boot linux install images automatically,
upgrade to Windows XP and so on.

<p>

Focus on the end result, not the means of getting there. :)

<p>

Just install Windows 98 in the normal way.  You can either do a full install, or perhaps even just format
that partition as a system drive.  The important thing is that you get the dosutils directory from the
Red Hat CD-ROM copied into the Windows 98 partition.  It's what we are going to have to run for linux.

<p>

The best way to do a full Windows 98 install is by copying the entire CD onto the partition.  That way
you can put the hard disk back in your Thinkpad and run the install there reducing the driver problems
etc.  This is very new hardware and Windows 98 is quite old so don't expect networking etc to work.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Installing Linux</h2>

After you have Windows 98 and the linux partitions we are ready to try the install. Boot into Windows 98
in command line mode and run autoboot.bat in the dosutils directory.  We are going to try and do a
network installation of Linux.

<p>

I believe that at one point the built in Intel Pro/100 VE network card worked during the linux installation.
But later it wouldn't work.  I don't know why, perhaps it was 6am and I was delusional.  I used my pcmcia
network card to do the install in the end.  This worked, you might have luck without it.

<p>

I leave the details of a linux network install to other people.

<p>

Don't expect X Windows or networking to play nicely out of the box.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Getting X Windows to Work</h2>

X Windows didn't work properly for me the first time.  The ATI Radeon card is very new.  After a lot of
digging around I found one of those 1 line gems in a discussion list that solved my problem.

<p>

When you try to start X Windows you should get a massive memory dump error:
<ul>
    startx
</ul>

<p>

Somewhere in all of that it tells you the name of the configuration file it was trying to use.  For me
that was:
<ul>
    /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
</ul>

<p>

Go to the Device section in that file and add the VideoRam 32768 line to make it look something like this:
<pre>
    Section "Device"
        Identifier "ATI|Radeon Mobility M6 LY"
        Driver "radeon"
        VideoRam 32768
        BoardName "Unknown"
        Option "nodri"
    EndSection
</pre>

<p>

Try starting X windows again and like magic it should work.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Getting Network Capabilities in Linux</h2>

The network card in this machine is so new that even under Windows XP a special driver download is needed
from IBM.  Same under Linux.  As best I can tell, the network card is a "Intel Pro/100 VE".  After a lot
of different Internet searches I found this page:
<ul>
    <a href="http://appsr.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?ProductID=407&DwnldID=2896">http://appsr.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?ProductID=407&DwnldID=2896</a>
</ul>

<p>

The readme file from there describes the entire installation which is really simple once you get kernel source
installed on the machine.  Of course, since you still don't have networking you probably need to be using
a pcmcia network card to do a lot of this work and copying.  You can install the kernel source using the RPMS
on the 2nd Red Hat CD.  Use rpm --install on the kernel source package.  Then copy and do the same for each
dependency package until it will actually install.  Don't worry, there are only about 5.

<p>

After that, compiling the driver is a snap.  Then getting it to work is also simple.  I have DHCP so I didn't
even need the IP address that the Intel readme tells you to use.  You might need to use eth1 if you have a
pcmcia network card installed when you try this.  I just moved the network connection over before running
the ifconfig command.
<pre>
    insmod e100
    ifconfig eth0
</pre>

<p>

It works!

<p>

I haven't worked out how to get this to start automatically on boot, or even better as a hotplug device.

<p>
<br>

<h2>The Modem Under Linux</h2>

As best I can work out it is not possible to use the modem under Linux.

<p>

<a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/qtechinfo/MIGR-4ZKKVZ.html?lang=en_US&page=brand&brand=IBM+ThinkPad&family=IBM+ThinkPad%7CThinkPad+T23&machineType=&doctype=Downloadable+files&subtype=Modems&up=">Here</a> is the IBM page talking about the type of modem installed.

<p>

<a href="http://www.linmodems.org">Here is more information about linmodems (the Linux equivalent of winmodems), and in particular
<a href="http://www.heby.de/ltmodem">information</a> about how Lucent AMR modems are definitely not supported in Linux.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Installing Windows XP</h2>

You can install Windows XP from within Windows 2000, or if you installed the full thing, Windows 98.  You
just have to mount the installation CD on the samba cd-rom drive you have on your network.  Or like me,
the samba CD-ROM drive that you setup on your network to support installations for your fancy new notebook
that doesn't have basic facilities like a CD-ROM.  You might be able to do something funky here with
a USB drive etc by telling the machine to boot using an "alternate boot device".

<p>

The installation should run very smoothly.  The only issue is networking (again).  You will need to
download the drivers that are available from IBM.  The trick here is working out it is the same networking
setup as the T23.  IBM has info and drivers for the T23, but has absolutely nothing (at the time of
writing) for the X22.

<p>

IBM calls it the "IBM High Rate Wireless LAN Mini-PCI Combo card".  You can download the drivers
<a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/qtechinfo/MIGR-4ZVMXK.html?lang=en_US&page=brand&brand=IBM+ThinkPad&doctype=Downloadable+files&subtype=Cat">here</a>.
I think in the last day they've added something saying this works with the X22.  Installation and setup
is simple.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Installing Software from Samba Mounted CD-ROM</h2>

In trying to install things like Microsoft Office etc I had to do it from a Samba mounted CD-ROM drive.  This
is easy once you work out that there is a unhide option when mounting a CD-ROM.  These installation disks
have a number of hidden files.  You get really strange errors when trying to install if the setup programs
can't find these hidden files.
<pre>
    mount -o unhide /mnt/cdrom
</pre>

<p>

This one really stumped me for a while!

<p>
<br>

<h2>A Boot Manager</h2>

After shelling out all that money for Partition Magic I thought I might as well use its included boot manager
since it is able to talk to all the different operating systems.  Apparently there can be hassles with lilo
or Windows XP boot options when trying to talk between Linux etc.  I have lilo dual booting Windows XP and
Linux on my desktop, but didn't want to risk more trouble during this install.

<p>

The Boot Magic program works like a treat.  Easy to setup.  Another good trick is to just add the IBM Service
partition to the boot options, although hopefully you'll never have to run it again.

<p>
<br>

<h2>Good Luck!</h2>

I think that is just about all of the problems I encountered during machine setup.  I haven't played much
with the wireless networking yet.  I'm confident that it can all
be solved from this point though with time.  When I had the machine in a state of the IBM Service partition
not installing properly, Partition Magic reporting the whole drive as a bad partition and no OS installed
I was pretty worried (grin).

<p>

You can post comments or suggestions for others below.  Sorry if I can't answer your emails for help, I'm
now really far behind on project work after this setup interlude (grin).
