<h2>Introduction</h2>

After you've installed MySQL it's often a good and convenient idea to make it start and stop automatically with the machine.  These instructions are specific for <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat Linux</a> and it's variants since different Linux distributions tend to layout the start up scripts differently.

<p>

The example script is based on my <a href="install-mysql3xx-on-linux.html">MySQL installation instructions</a>.

<p>

<h2>Making MySQL Start and Stop Automatically</h2>

<ol>

<li>You need to be root to do these steps:
<pre>
    su root
</pre>

<p>

<li>Now go to the MySQL directory:
<pre>
    cd /usr/local/mysql
</pre>

<p>

<li>First we have to put the start up script with all the others.
<pre>
    cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql
</pre>

<p>

<li>To make the script be run on machine start up we need to create a symbolic link to it.
<pre>
    cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
    ln -s ../init.d/mysql S85mysql
    cd /etc/rc.d/rc5.d
    ln -s ../init.d/mysql S85mysql
</pre>

<p>

<li>Now the links to make MySQL shut down:
<pre>
    cd /etc/rc.d/rc0.d
    ln -s ../init.d/mysql K85mysql
    cd /etc/rc.d/rc6.d
    ln -s ../init.d/mysql K85mysql
</pre>

<p>

<li>The mysql script must have execute permissions before it will work.
<pre>
    cd ../init.d
    chmod +x mysql
</pre>

<p>

<li>You may need to change the user that mysql should be run as.  Look for the mysqld_user variable
about half way through the script and change it to be the appropriate user.  If you used our MySQL
install instructions the user should be mysql.

<p>

<li>You can now reboot your machine to test this setup.
<pre>
    shutdown -r now
</pre>

<p>

<li>When the machine starts, check that the mysql daemon actually started:
<pre>
    cd /usr/local/mysql
    bin/mysqladmin -uroot -p[admin password  <em>eg. mypass</em>] ping
</pre>
Hopefully you get this response:
<pre>
    mysqld is alive
</pre>
If you get a message like this then something went wrong:
<pre>
    mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
    error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server (2)'
    Check that mysqld is running and that the socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' exists!
</pre>

</ol>
